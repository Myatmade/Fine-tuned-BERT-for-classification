this paper explores the link between education and the decision to start smoking as well as the decision to quit smoking data is gathered from ipums cps and centers for disease control and prevention probit analysis with the use of probability weight and robust standard error indicates that every additional year of education will reduce the 23 percentage point of the smoking probability and will add 353 percentage point in quitting likelihood holding home restriction public restriction cigarette price family income age gender race and ethnicity constant i believe that tobacco epidemic is a serious global issue that may be mitigated by using careful regulations on smoking restriction and education,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14834v1,Sociology
anonymized electronic medical records are an increasingly popular source of research data however these datasets often lack race and ethnicity information this creates problems for researchers modeling human disease as race and ethnicity are powerful confounders for many health exposures and treatment outcomes race and ethnicity are closely linked to populationspecific genetic variation we showed that deep neural networks generate more accurate estimates for missing racial and ethnic information than competing methods eg logistic regression random forest riddle yielded significantly better classification performance across all metrics that were considered accuracy crossentropy loss error and area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic plots all p 106 we made specific efforts to interpret the trained neural network models to identify quantify and visualize medical features which are predictive of race and ethnicity we used these characterizations of informative features to perform a systematic comparison of differential disease patterns by race and ethnicity the fact that clinical histories are informative for imputing race and ethnicity could reflect 1 a skewed distribution of blue and whitecollar professions across racial and ethnic groups 2 uneven accessibility and subjective importance of prophylactic health 3 possible variation in lifestyle such as dietary habits and 4 differences in background genetic variation which predispose to diseases,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01623v2,Sociology
open source software oss projects are typically the result of collective efforts performed by developers with different backgrounds although the quality of developers contributions should be the only factor influencing the evaluation of the contributions to oss projects recent studies have shown that diversity issues are correlated with the acceptance or rejection of developers contributions this paper assists this emerging stateoftheart body on diversity research with the first empirical study that analyzes how developers perceptible race and ethnicity relates to the evaluation of the contributions in oss we performed a largescale quantitative study of oss projects in github we extracted the developers perceptible race and ethnicity from their names in github using the nameprism tool and applied regression modeling of contributions ie pull requests data from ghtorrent and github we observed that among the developers whose perceptible race and ethnicity was captured by the tool only 1656 were perceptible as nonwhite developers contributions from perceptible white developers have about 610 higher odds of being accepted when compared to contributions from perceptible nonwhite developers and submitters with perceptible nonwhite races and ethnicities are more likely to get their pull requests accepted when the integrator is estimated to be from their same race and ethnicity rather than when the integrator is estimated to be white our initial analysis shows a low number of nonwhite developers participating in oss furthermore the results from our regression analysis lead us to believe that there may exist differences between the evaluation of the contributions from different perceptible races and ethnicities thus our findings reinforce the need for further studies on racial and ethnic diversity in software engineering to foster healthier oss communities,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06143v1,Sociology
to answer questions about racial inequality and fairness we often need a way to infer race and ethnicity from names one way to infer race and ethnicity from names is by relying on the census bureaus list of popular last names the list however suffers from at least three limitations 1 it only contains last names 2 it only includes popular last names and 3 it is updated once every 10 years to provide better generalization and higher accuracy when first names are available we model the relationship between characters in a name and race and ethnicity using various techniques a model using long shortterm memory works best with outofsample accuracy of 85 the bestperforming lastname model achieves outofsample accuracy of 81 to illustrate the utility of the models we apply them to campaign finance data to estimate the share of donations made by people of various racial groups and to news data to estimate the coverage of various races and ethnicities in the news,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02109v2,Sociology
a common practice in evidencebased decisionmaking uses estimates of conditional probabilities pyx obtained from research studies to predict outcomes y on the basis of observed covariates x given this information decisions are then based on the predicted outcomes researchers commonly assume that the predictors used in the generation of the evidence are the same as those used in applying the evidence ie the meaning of x in the two circumstances is the same this may not be the case in realworld settings across a widerange of settings ranging from clinical practice or education policy demographic attributes eg age race ethnicity are often classified differently in research studies than in decision settings this paper studies identification in such settings we propose a formal framework for prediction with what we term differential covariate classification dcc using this framework we analyze partial identification of probabilistic predictions and assess how various assumptions influence the identification regions we apply the findings to a range of settings focusing mainly on differential classification of individuals race and ethnicity in clinical medicine we find that bounds on pyx can be wide and the information needed to narrow them available only in special cases these findings highlight an important problem in using evidence in decision making a problem that has not yet been fully appreciated in debates on classification in public policy and medicine,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02318v1,Sociology
there is active debate over whether to consider patient race and ethnicity when estimating disease risk by accounting for race and ethnicity it is possible to improve the accuracy of risk predictions but there is concern that their use may encourage a racialized view of medicine in diabetes risk models despite substantial gains in statistical accuracy from using race and ethnicity the gains in clinical utility are surprisingly modest these modest clinical gains stem from two empirical patterns first the vast majority of individuals receive the same screening recommendation regardless of whether race or ethnicity are included in risk models and second for those who do receive different screening recommendations the difference in utility between screening and not screening is relatively small our results are based on broad statistical principles and so are likely to generalize to many other riskbased clinical decisions,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10220v1,Sociology

the multidisciplinary and socially anchored nature of feminist studies presents unique challenges for bibliometric analysis as this research area transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries and reflects discussions from feminist and lgbtqia social movements this paper proposes a novel approach for identifying gendersex related publications scattered across diverse scientific disciplines using the dimensions database we employ bibliometric techniques natural language processing nlp and manual curation to compile a dataset of scientific publications that allows for the analysis of gender studies and its influence across different disciplines this is achieved through a methodology that combines a core of specialized journals with a comprehensive keyword search over titles these keywords are obtained by applying topic modeling bertopic to the corpus of titles and abstracts from the core this methodological strategy divided into two stages reflects the dynamic interaction between gender studies and its dialogue with different disciplines this hybrid system surpasses basic keyword search by mitigating potential biases introduced through manual keyword enumeration the resulting dataset comprises over 19 million scientific documents published between 1668 and 2023 spanning four languages this dataset enables a characterization of gender studies in terms of addressed topics citation and collaboration dynamics and institutional and regional participation by addressing the methodological challenges of studying morethandisciplinary research areas this approach could also be adapted to delineate other conversations where disciplinary boundaries are difficult to disentangle,http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18306v1,Sociology
in 2018 the us census bureau designed a new data reconstruction and reidentification attack and tested it against their 2010 data release the specific attack executed by the bureau allows an attacker to infer the race and ethnicity of respondents with average 75 precision for 85 of the respondents assuming that the attacker knows the correct age sex and address of the respondents they interpreted the attack as exceeding the bureaus privacy standards and so introduced stronger privacy protections for the 2020 census in the form of the topdown algorithm tda this paper demonstrates that race and ethnicity can be inferred from the tdaprotected census data with substantially better precision and recall using less prior knowledge only the respondents address race and ethnicity can be inferred with average 75 precision for 98 of the respondents and can be inferred with 100 precision for 11 of the respondents the inference is done by simply assuming that the raceethnicity of the respondent is that of the majority raceethnicity for the respondents census block the conclusion to draw from this simple demonstration is not that the bureaus data releases lack adequate privacy protections indeed it is the purpose of the data releases to allow this kind of inference the problem rather is that the bureaus criteria for measuring privacy is flawed and overly pessimistic,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04872v2,Sociology

fairnessaware learning is a novel framework for classification tasks like regular empirical risk minimization erm it aims to learn a classifier with a low error rate and at the same time for the predictions of the classifier to be independent of sensitive features such as gender religion race and ethnicity existing methods can achieve low dependencies on given samples but this is not guaranteed on unseen samples the existing fairnessaware learning algorithms employ different dependency measures and each algorithm is specifically designed for a particular one such diversity makes it difficult to theoretically analyze and compare them in this paper we propose a general framework for fairnessaware learning that uses fdivergences and that covers most of the dependency measures employed in the existing methods we introduce a way to estimate the fdivergences that allows us to give a unified analysis for the upper bound of the estimation error this bound is tighter than that of the existing convergence rate analysis of the divergence estimation with our divergence estimate we propose a fairnessaware learning algorithm and perform a theoretical analysis of its generalization error our analysis reveals that under mild assumptions and even with enforcement of fairness the generalization error of our method is osqrt1n which is the same as that of the regular erm in addition and more importantly we show that for any fdivergence the upper bound of the estimation error of the divergence is osqrt1n this indicates that our fairnessaware learning algorithm guarantees low dependencies on unseen samples for any dependency measure represented by an fdivergence,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07721v1,Sociology

in many application areas predictive models are used to support or make important decisions there is increasing awareness that these models may contain spurious or otherwise undesirable correlations such correlations may arise from a variety of sources including batch effects systematic measurement errors or sampling bias without explicit adjustment machine learning algorithms trained using these data can produce poor outofsample predictions which propagate these undesirable correlations we propose a method to preprocess the training data producing an adjusted dataset that is statistically independent of the nuisance variables with minimum information loss we develop a conceptually simple approach for creating an adjusted dataset in highdimensional settings based on a constrained form of matrix decomposition the resulting dataset can then be used in any predictive algorithm with the guarantee that predictions will be statistically independent of the group variable we develop a scalable algorithm for implementing the method along with theory support in the form of independence guarantees and optimality the method is illustrated on some simulation examples and applied to two case studies removing machinespecific correlations from brain scan data and removing race and ethnicity information from a dataset used to predict recidivism that the motivation for removing undesirable correlations is quite different in the two applications illustrates the broad applicability of our approach,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08255v2,Sociology

measuring average differences in an outcome across racial or ethnic groups is a crucial first step for equity assessments but researchers often lack access to data on individuals races and ethnicities to calculate them a common solution is to impute the missing race or ethnicity labels using proxies then use those imputations to estimate the disparity conventional standard errors mischaracterize the resulting estimates uncertainty because they treat the imputation model as given and fixed instead of as an unknown object that must be estimated with uncertainty we propose a dualbootstrap approach that explicitly accounts for measurement uncertainty and thus enables more accurate statistical inference which we demonstrate via simulation in addition we adapt our approach to the commonly used bayesian improved surname geocoding bisg imputation algorithm where direct bootstrapping is infeasible because the underlying census bureau data are unavailable in simulations we find that measurement uncertainty is generally insignificant for bisg except in particular circumstances bias not variance is likely the predominant source of error we apply our method to quantify the uncertainty of prevalence estimates of common health conditions by race using data from the american family cohort,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06238v1,Sociology

social movements rely in large measure on networked communication technologies to organize and disseminate information relating to the movements objectives in this work we seek to understand how the goals and needs of a protest movement are reflected in the geographic patterns of its communication network and how these patterns differ from those of stable political communication to this end we examine an online communication network reconstructed from over 600000 tweets from a thirtysix week period covering the birth and maturation of the american anticapitalist movement occupy wall street we find that compared to a network of stable domestic political communication the occupy wall street network exhibits higher levels of locality and a hub and spoke structure in which the majority of nonlocal attention is allocated to highprofile locations such as new york california and washington dc moreover we observe that information flows across state boundaries are more likely to contain framing language and references to the media while communication among individuals in the same state is more likely to reference protest action and specific places and and times tying these results to social movement theory we propose that these features reflect the movements efforts to mobilize resources at the local level and to develop narrative frames that reinforce collective purpose at the national level,http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5473v1,Sociology

the abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and groupspecific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics in contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions stance detection identifies precise positions ie supportive opposing neutral relative to a welldefined topic such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the covid19 pandemic traditional stance detection models while effective within their specific domain eg attitudes towards masking protocols during covid19 often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution this limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domainspecific labeled datasets which are expensive and laborintensive to create a solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest we evaluate the performance of current stateoftheart stance detection models including a promptoptimized large language model relative to our proposed framework succinctly called stancec3 domainadaptive crosstarget stance detection via contrastive learning and counterfactual generation empirical evaluations demonstrate stancec3s consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics despite the increasing prevalence of generalpurpose models such as generative ai specialized models such as stancec3 provide utility in safetycritical domains wherein precision is highly valued especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2,Sociology
causal machine learning tools are beginning to see use in realworld policy evaluation tasks to flexibly estimate treatment effects one issue with these methods is that the machine learning models used are generally black boxes ie there is no globally interpretable way to understand how a model makes estimates this is a clear problem in policy evaluation applications particularly in government because it is difficult to understand whether such models are functioning in ways that are fair based on the correct interpretation of evidence and transparent enough to allow for accountability if things go wrong however there has been little discussion of transparency problems in the causal machine learning literature and how these might be overcome this paper explores why transparency issues are a problem for causal machine learning in public policy evaluation applications and considers ways these problems might be addressed through explainable ai tools and by simplifying models in line with interpretable ai principles it then applies these ideas to a casestudy using a causal forest model to estimate conditional average treatment effects for a hypothetical change in the school leaving age in australia it shows that existing tools for understanding blackbox predictive models are poorly suited to causal machine learning and that simplifying the model to make it interpretable leads to an unacceptable increase in error in this application it concludes that new tools are needed to properly understand causal machine learning models and the algorithms that fit them,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13240v2,Sociology

we study a behavioral sir model with timevarying costs of distancing the two main causes of the variation in the cost of distancing we explore are distancing fatigue and public policies lockdowns we show that for a second wave of an epidemic to arise a steep increase in distancing cost is necessary distancing fatigue cannot increase the distancing cost sufficiently fast to create a second wave however public policies that discontinuously affect the distancing cost can create a second wave with that in mind we characterize the largest change in the distancing cost due to for example lifting a public policy that will not cause a second wave finally we provide a numerical analysis of public policies under distancing fatigue and show that a strict lockdown at the beginning of an epidemic as for example recently in china can lead to unintended adverse consequences when the policy is lifted the disease spreads very fast due to the accumulated distancing fatigue of the individuals causing high prevalence levels,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03847v2,Sociology

the design of coherent and efficient policies to address infectious diseases and their consequences requires to model not only epidemics dynamics but also individual behaviors as the latter has a strong influence on the former in our work we provide a theoretical model for this problem taking into account the social structure of a population this model is based on a mean field game version of a sir compartmental model in which individuals are grouped by their age class and interact together in different settings this social heterogeneity allows to reproduce realistic situations while remaining usable in practice in our game theoretical approach individuals can choose to limit their contacts by making a tradeoff between the risks incurred by infection and the cost of being confined the aggregation of all these individual choices and optimizations forms a nash equilibrium through a system of coupled equations that we derive and solve numerically the global cost born by the population within this scenario is then compared to its societal optimum counterpart ie the optimal cost from the society viewpoint and we investigate how the gap between these two costs can be partially bridged within a constrained nash equilibrium for which a governmental institution would impose lockdowns finally we consider the consequences of the finiteness of the population size n or of a time t at which an external event would end the epidemic and show that the variation of these parameters could lead to first order phase transitions in the choice of optimal strategies in this paper all the strategies considered to mitigate epidemics correspond to nonpharmaceutical interventions npi and we provide here a theoretical framework within which guidelines for public policies depending on the characteristics of an epidemic and on the cost of restrictions on the society could be assessed,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08758v1,Sociology

social inequality manifested across different strata of human existence can be quantified in several ways here we compute nonentropic measures of inequality such as lorenz curve gini index and the recently introduced k index analytically from known distribution functions we characterize the distribution functions of different quantities such as votes journal citations city size etc with suitable fits compute their inequality measures and compare with the analytical results a single analytic function is often not sufficient to fit the entire range of the probability distribution of the empirical data and fit better to two distinct functions with a single crossover point here we provide general formulas to calculate these inequality measures for the above cases we attempt to specify the crossover point by minimizing the gap between empirical and analytical evaluations of measures regarding the k index as an extra dimension both the lower and upper bounds of the gini index are obtained as a function of the k index this type of inequality relations among inequality indices might help us to check the validity of empirical and analytical evaluations of those indices,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2874v1,Sociology
controversies around race and machine learning have sparked debate among computer scientists over how to design machine learning systems that guarantee fairness these debates rarely engage with how racial identity is embedded in our social experience making for sociological and psychological complexity this complexity challenges the paradigm of considering fairness to be a formal property of supervised learning with respect to protected personal attributes racial identity is not simply a personal subjective quality for people labeled black it is an ascribed political category that has consequences for social differentiation embedded in systemic patterns of social inequality achieved through both social and spatial segregation in the united states racial classification can best be understood as a system of inherently unequal status categories that places whites as the most privileged category while signifying the negroblack category as stigmatized social stigma is reinforced through the unequal distribution of societal rewards and goods along racial lines that is reinforced by state corporate and civic institutions and practices this creates a dilemma for society and designers be blind to racial group disparities and thereby reify racialized social inequality by no longer measuring systemic inequality or be conscious of racial categories in a way that itself reifies race we propose a third option by preceding group fairness interventions with unsupervised learning to dynamically detect patterns of segregation machine learning systems can mitigate the root cause of social disparities social segregation and stratification without further anchoring status categories of disadvantage,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11668v1,Sociology
human deaths caused by individual manmade conflicts eg wars armedconflicts terroristattacks etc occur unequally across the events conflicts and such inequality in deaths have been studied here using lorenz curve and values of the inequality indices gini g and kolkata k have been estimated from it the data are taken from various wellknown databases maintained by some universities and peace research institutes the inequality measures for manmade conflicts are found to have very high values g 082 pm 002 k 084 pm 002 which is rarely seen in economic income or wealth inequality measures across the world g leq 04 k leq 06 presumably because of various welfare measures we also investigated the inequalities in human deaths from natural disasters like earthquakes floods etc interestingly we observe that the social inequality measures g and k values from manmade conflicts compare well with those of academic centers inequality in citations found in earlier studies of different institutions of the world while those for natural disasters can be even higher we discuss about the similarity classes of social inequality similar higher values of g and k indices for manmade competitive societies like academic institutions and manmade social conflicts and connect our observations with that of the growing recent trend of economic inequality across the world with rapid disappearance of welfare strategies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05709v8,Sociology
social inequalities are ubiquitous and here we show that the values of the gini g and kolkata k indices two generic inequality indices approach each other starting from g 0 and k 05 for equality as the competitions grow in various social institutions like markets universities elections etc it is further showed that these two indices become equal and stabilize at a value at g k simeq 087 under unrestricted competitions we propose to view this coincidence of inequality indices as a generalized version of the more than a century old 8020 law of pareto furthermore the coincidence of the inequality indices noted here is very similar to the ones seen before for selforganized critical soc systems the observations here therefore stand as a quantitative support towards viewing interacting socioeconomic systems in the framework of soc an idea conjectured for years,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07516v5,Sociology
statistical physicists and social scientists both study extensively some characteristic features of the unequal distributions of energy cluster or avalanche sizes and of income wealth etc among the particles or sites and population respectively while physicists concentrate on the selfsimilar fractal structure and the characteristic exponents of the largest percolating cluster or avalanche social scientists study the inequality indices like gini and kolkata etc given by the nonlinearity of the lorenz function representing the cumulative fraction of the wealth possessed by different fraction of the population we review here using results from earlier publications and some new numerical as well as analytical results how the abovementioned social inequality indices when extracted from the unequal distributions of energy in kinetic exchange models cluster sizes in percolation models or avalanche sizes in selforganized critical or fiber bundle models can help in a major way in providing precursor signals for an approaching critical point or imminent failure point extensive numerical and some analytical results have been discussed,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04276v3,Sociology
visualization research often focuses on perceptual accuracy or helping readers interpret key messages however we know very little about how chart designs might influence readers perceptions of the people behind the data specifically could designs interact with readers social cognitive biases in ways that perpetuate harmful stereotypes for example when analyzing social inequality bar charts are a popular choice to present outcome disparities between race gender or other groups but bar charts may encourage deficit thinking the perception that outcome disparities are caused by groups personal strengths or deficiencies rather than external factors these faulty personal attributions can then reinforce stereotypes about the groups being visualized we conducted four experiments examining design choices that influence attribution biases and therefore deficit thinking crowdworkers viewed visualizations depicting social outcomes that either mask variability in data such as bar charts or dot plots or emphasize variability in data such as jitter plots or prediction intervals they reported their agreement with both personal and external explanations for the visualized disparities overall when participants saw visualizations that hide withingroup variability they agreed more with personal explanations when they saw visualizations that emphasize withingroup variability they agreed less with personal explanations these results demonstrate that data visualizations about social inequity can be misinterpreted in harmful ways and lead to stereotyping design choices can influence these biases hiding variability tends to increase stereotyping while emphasizing variability reduces it,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04440v2,Sociology

the spread of ideas across a social network can be studied using complex contagion models in which agents are activated by contact with multiple activated neighbors the investigation of complex contagions can provide crucial insights into social influence and behavioradoption cascades on networks in this paper we introduce a model of a multistage complex contagion on networks agents at different stages which could for example represent differing levels of support for a social movement or differing levels of commitment to a certain product or idea exert different amounts of influence on their neighbors we demonstrate that the presence of even one additional stage introduces novel dynamical behavior including interplay between multiple cascades that cannot occur in singlestage contagion models we find that cascades and hence collective action can be driven not only by highstage influencers but also by lowstage influencers,http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1596v2,Sociology

how does political discourse spread in digital networks can we empirically test if certain conceptual frames of social movements have a correlate on their online discussion networks through an analysis of the twitter data from the occupy movement this paper describes the formation of political discourse over time building on a previous set of concepts derived from theoretical discussions about the movement and its roots we analyse the data to observe when those concepts start to appear within the networks who are those twitter users responsible for them and what are the patterns through which those concepts spread preliminary evidence shows that although there are some signs of opportunistic behaviour among activists most of them are central nodes from the onset of the network and shape the discussions across time these central activists do not only start the conversations around given frames but also sustain over time and become key members of the network from here we aim to provide a thorough account of the travel of political discourse and the correlate of online conversational networks with theoretical accounts of the movement,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1176v1,Sociology

network data is increasingly being used in quantitative datadriven public policy research these are typically very rich datasets that contain complex correlations and interdependencies this richness both promises to be quite useful for policy research while at the same time posing a challenge for the useful extraction of information from these datasets a challenge which calls for new data analysis methods in this report we formulate a research agenda of key methodological problems whose solutions would enable new advances across many areas of policy research we then review recent advances in applying deep learning to network data and show how these methods may be used to address many of the methodological problems we identified we particularly emphasize deep generative methods which can be used to generate realistic synthetic networks useful for microsimulation and agentbased models capable of informing key public policy questions we extend these recent advances by developing a new generative framework which applies to large social contact networks commonly used in epidemiological modeling for context we also compare and contrast these recent neural networkbased approaches with the more traditional exponential random graph models lastly we discuss some open problems where more progress is needed,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07870v2,Sociology
governments are increasingly turning to algorithmic risk assessments when making important decisions such as whether to release criminal defendants before trial policymakers assert that providing public servants with algorithmic advice will improve human risk predictions and thereby lead to better eg fairer decisions yet because many policy decisions require balancing riskreduction with competing goals improving the accuracy of predictions may not necessarily improve the quality of decisions if risk assessments make people more attentive to reducing risk at the expense of other values these algorithms would diminish the implementation of public policy even as they lead to more accurate predictions through an experiment with 2140 lay participants simulating two highstakes government contexts we provide the first direct evidence that risk assessments can systematically alter how people factor risk into their decisions these shifts counteracted the potential benefits of improved prediction accuracy in the pretrial setting of our experiment the risk assessment made participants more sensitive to increases in perceived risk this shift increased the racial disparity in pretrial detention by 19 in the government loans setting of our experiment the risk assessment made participants more riskaverse this shift reduced government aid by 83 these results demonstrate the potential limits and harms of attempts to improve public policy by incorporating predictive algorithms into multifaceted policy decisions if these observed behaviors occur in practice presenting risk assessments to public servants would generate unexpected and unjust shifts in public policy without being subject to democratic deliberation or oversight,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05370v2,Sociology

social security and other public policies can be viewed as a series of cash in and outflows that depend on parameters such as the age distribution of the population and the retirement age given forecasts of these parameters policies can be designed to be financially stable ie to terminate with a zero balance if reality deviates from the forecasts policies normally terminate with a surplus or a deficit we derive constraints on the cash flows of robust policies that terminate with zero balance even in the presence of forecasting errors social security and most similar policies are not robust we show that nontrivial robust policies exist and provide a recipe for constructing robust extensions of nonrobust policies an example illustrates our results,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6340v1,Sociology

how should we think of the preferences of citizens whereas selfoptimal policy is relatively straightforward to produce socially optimal policy often requires a more detailed examination in this paper we identify an issue that has received far too little attention in welfarist modelling of public policy which we name the hidden assumptions problem hidden assumptions can be deceptive because they are not expressed explicitly and the social planner eg a policy maker a regulator a legislator may not give them the critical attention they need we argue that ethical expertise has a direct role to play in public discourse because it is hard to adopt a position on major issues like public health policy or healthcare prioritisation without making contentious assumptions about population ethics we then postulate that ethicists are best situated to critically evaluate these hidden assumptions and can therefore play a vital role in public policy debates,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01957v1,Sociology

mathematical modelling has served a central role in studying how infectious disease transmission manifests at the population level these models have demonstrated the importance of populationlevel factors like social network heterogeneity on structuring epidemic risk and are now routinely used in public health for decision support one barrier to broader utility of mathematical models is that the existing canon does not readily accommodate the social determinants of health as distinct formal drivers of transmission dynamics given the decades of empirical support for the organizational effect of social determinants on health burden more generally and infectious disease risk more specially addressing this modelling gap is of critical importance in this study we build on prior efforts to integrate social forces into mathematical epidemiology by introducing several new metrics principally structural causal influence sci here sci leverages causal analysis to provide a measure of the relative vulnerability of subgroups within a susceptible population which are crafted by differences in healthcare exposure to disease and other determinants we develop our metrics using a general case and apply it to specific one of public health importance hepatitis c virus in a population of persons who inject drugs our use of the sci reveals that under specific parameters in a multicommunity model the less vulnerable community may sustain a basic reproduction number below one when isolated ensuring disease extinction however even minimal transmission between less and more vulnerable communities can elevate this number leading to sustained epidemics within both communities summarizing we reflect on our findings in light of conversations surrounding the importance of social inequalities and how their consideration can influence the study and practice of mathematical epidemiology,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09096v1,Sociology

recent conversations in the algorithmic fairness literature have raised several concerns with standard conceptions of fairness first constraining predictive algorithms to satisfy fairness benchmarks may lead to nonoptimal outcomes for disadvantaged groups second technical interventions are often ineffective by themselves especially when divorced from an understanding of structural processes that generate social inequality inspired by both these critiques we construct a common decisionmaking model using mortgage loans as a running example we show that under some conditions any choice of decision threshold will inevitably perpetuate existing disparities in financial stability unless one deviates from the pareto optimal policy then we model the effects of three different types of interventions we show how different interventions are recommended depending upon the difficulty of enacting structural change upon external parameters and depending upon the policymakers preferences for equity or efficiency counterintuitively we demonstrate that preferences for efficiency over equity may lead to recommendations for interventions that target the underresourced group finally we simulate the effects of interventions on a dataset that combines hmda and fannie mae loan data this research highlights the ways that structural inequality can be perpetuated by seemingly unbiased decision mechanisms and it shows that in many situations technical solutions must be paired with external contextaware interventions to enact social change,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01323v1,Sociology
there is an ongoing debate on balancing the benefits and risks of artificial intelligence ai as ai is becoming critical to improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes such improvements are essential in resourceconstrained settings where millions lack access to adequate healthcare services such as in africa ai in such a context can potentially improve the effectiveness efficiency and accessibility of healthcare services nevertheless the development and use of aidriven healthcare systems raise numerous ethical legal and socioeconomic issues justice is a major concern in ai that has implications for amplifying social inequities this paper discusses these implications and related justice concepts such as solidarity common good sustainability ai bias and fairness for africa to effectively benefit from ai these principles should align with the local context while balancing the risks compared to mainstream ethical debates on justice this perspective offers contextspecific considerations for equitable healthcare ai development in africa,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10653v1,Sociology
the sharply increasing sizes of artificial intelligence ai models come with significant energy consumption and environmental footprints which can disproportionately impact certain often marginalized regions and hence create environmental inequity concerns moreover concerns with social inequity have also emerged as ai computing resources may not be equitably distributed across the globe and users from certain disadvantaged regions with severe resource constraints can consistently experience inferior model performance importantly the inequity concerns that encompass both social and environmental dimensions still remain unexplored and have increasingly hindered responsible ai in this paper we leverage the spatial flexibility of ai inference workloads and propose equitable geographical load balancing glb to fairly balance ais regional social and environmental costs concretely to penalize the disproportionately high social and environmental costs for equity we introduce lq norms as novel regularization terms into the optimization objective for glb decisions our empirical results based on realworld ai inference traces demonstrate that while the existing glb algorithms result in disproportionately large social and environmental costs in certain regions our proposed equitable glb can fairly balance ais negative social and environmental costs across all the regions,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05176v1,Sociology
data science pipelines inform and influence many daily decisions from what we buy to who we work for and even where we live when designed incorrectly these pipelines can easily propagate social inequity and harm traditional solutions are technical in nature eg mitigating biased algorithms in this vision paper we introduce a novel lens for promoting responsible data science using theories of behavior change that emphasize not only technical solutions but also the behavioral responsibility of practitioners by integrating behavior change theories from cognitive psychology with data science workflow knowledge and ethics guidelines we present a new perspective on responsible data science we present example data science interventions in machine learning and visual data analysis contextualized in behavior change theories that could be implemented to interrupt and redirect potentially suboptimal or negligent practices while reinforcing ethically conscious behaviors we conclude with a call to action to our community to explore this new research area of behavior change interventions for responsible data science,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17273v1,Sociology
liking it or not ready or not we are likely to enter a new phase of human history in which artificial intelligence ai will dominate economic production and social life the ai revolution before the actual arrival of the ai revolution it is time for us to speculate on how ai will impact the social world in this article we focus on the social impact of generative llmbased ai gellmai discussing societal factors that contribute to its technological development and its potential roles in enhancing both betweencountry and withincountry social inequality there are good indications that the us and china will lead the field and will be the main competitors for domination of ai in the world we conjecture the ai revolution will likely give rise to a postknowledge society in which knowledge per se will become less important than in todays world instead individual relationships and social identity will become more important so will soft skills,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21281v1,Sociology
dialectal arabic da varieties are underserved by language technologies particularly large language models llms this trend threatens to exacerbate existing social inequalities and limits llm applications yet the research community lacks operationalized performance measurements in da we present a framework that comprehensively assesses llms da modeling capabilities across four dimensions fidelity understanding quality and diglossia we evaluate nine llms in eight da varieties and provide practical recommendations our evaluation suggests that llms do not produce da as well as they understand it not because their da fluency is poor but because they are reluctant to generate da further analysis suggests that current posttraining can contribute to bias against da that fewshot examples can overcome this deficiency and that otherwise no measurable features of input text correlate well with llm da performance,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04193v2,Sociology
this paper investigates the impact of social discount rate sdr choice on intergenerational equity issues caused by publicprivate partnerships ppps projects indeed more ppps mean more debt being accumulated for future generations leading to a fiscal deficit crisis the paper draws on how the sdr level taken today distributes societies on the social welfare function swf this is done by answering two subquestions i what is the risk of ppps debts being offbalance sheet ii how do public policies based on the envisaged sdr position society within different ethical perspectives the answers are obtained from a discussion of the different sdrs applied in the uk for examples according to the merits of the pertinent ethical theories namely libertarian egalitarian utilitarian and rawlsian we find that public policymakers can manipulate the sdr to make ppps looking like a better option than the traditional financing form however this antagonises the value for money principle we also point out that public policy is not harmonised with ethical theories we find that at present in the uk the sdr is somewhere between weighted utilitarian and rawlsian societies in the tradeoff curve alas our study finds no evidence that the uk government is using a sophisticated system to keep pace with the accumulated offbalance sheet debts thus the exact prediction of the final state is hardly made because of the uncertainty factor we conclude that our study hopefully provides a good analytical framework for policymakers in order to draw on the merits of ethical theories before initiating public policies like ppps,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09064v1,Sociology
the improbability scale is is proposed as a way of communicating to the general public the improbability and by implication the probability of events predicted as the result of scientific research through the use of the improbability scale the public will be able to evaluate more easily the relative risks of predicted events and draw proper conclusions when asked to support governmental and public policy decisions arising from that research,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0503229v2,Sociology
besides an indicator of the gdp the central bank of venezuela generates the so called monthly economic activity general indicator the a priori knowledge of this indicator which represents and sometimes even anticipates the economys fluctuations could be helpful in developing public policies and in investment decision making the purpose of this study is forecasting the igaem through non parametric methods an approach that has proven effective in a wide variety of problems in economics and finance,http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.3463v1,Sociology
scientific publications and other genres of research output are increasingly being cited in policy documents citations in documents of this nature could be considered a critical indicator of the significance and societal impact of the research output in this study we built classification models that predict whether a particular research work is likely to be cited in a public policy document based on the attention it received online primarily on social media platforms we evaluated the classifiers based on their accuracy precision and recall values we found that random forest and multinomial naive bayes classifiers performed better overall,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04140v1,Sociology
risk including economic risk is increasingly a concern for public policy and management the possibility of dealing effectively with risk is hampered however by lack of a sound empirical basis for risk assessment and management the paper demonstrates the general point for cost and demand risks in urban rail projects the paper presents empirical evidence that allow valid economic risk assessment and management of urban rail projects including benchmarking of individual or groups of projects benchmarking of the copenhagen metro is presented as a case in point the approach developed is proposed as a model for other types of policies and projects in order to improve economic and financial risk assessment and management in policy and planning,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7402v1,Sociology
public policy making has direct and indirect impacts on social behaviors however using system dynamics model alone to assess these impacts fails to consider the interactions among social elements thus may produce doubtful conclusions in this study we examine the political science theory of greed and grievance in modeling civil conflicts an agentbased model is built based on an existing rebellion model in netlogo the modifications and improvements in our model are elaborated several case studies are used to demonstrate the use of our model for investigating emergent phenomena and implications of governmental policies,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06883v1,Sociology
