primordial stars are likely to be very massive geq30msun form in isolation and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of their host dark matter halos in the mass range 1061010ms such early black holes at redshifts zgtsim10 could be the seed black holes for the many supermassive black holes found in galaxies in the local universe if they exist their mergers with nearby supermassive black holes may be a prime signal for long wavelength gravitational wave detectors we simulate formation of black holes in the center of high redshift dark matter halos and explore implications of initial natal kick velocities conjectured by some formation models the central concentration of early black holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they are born even with moderate kicks of tens of kms the modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the lower mass black holes as compared to those still embedded in their parent halos therefore merger rates may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude using analytical and illustrative cosmological nbody simulations we quantify the role of natal kicks of black holes formed from massive metal free stars on their merger rates with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies our results also apply to black holes ejected by the gravitational slingshot mechanism,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512123v2,Astronomy
in this article we consider the growth of seed black holes immersed in dark matter halos we first investigate the adiabatic growth in various initial distribution functions isothermal power law and nfw and find the resulting density radial velocity and anisotropy profiles in addition we estimate the growth rate for a given black hole mass in the corresponding adiabatically modified dark matter distribution function only in the isothermal case is there a convincing black hole massage relation by calculating the line of sight velocity dispersion for the various cases as a function of the black hole mass we find the predicted adiabatic mbhsigma relation this never approaches the recently observed power law we conclude by abandoning adiabaticity suggesting that the black hole grows proportionally to the dark matter halo itself on a dynamic time scale this allows us to relate the observed mbhsigma relation to the cosmological power spectrum on galactic scales by using dimensional scaling arguments,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201153v1,Astronomy
we discuss the hypothesis that the cosmological baryon asymmetry and entropy were produced in the early universe by the primordial black hole pbhs evaporation,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009407v1,Astronomy
the first massive astrophysical black holes likely formed at high redshifts z10 at the centers of low mass 106 msun dark matter concentrations these black holes grow by mergers and gas accretion evolve into the population of bright quasars observed at lower redshifts and eventually leave the supermassive black hole remnants that are ubiquitous at the centers of galaxies in the nearby universe the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation of the earliest seed black holes are poorly understood the purpose of this review is threefold 1 to describe theoretical expectations for the formation and growth of the earliest black holes within the general paradigm of hierarchical cold dark matter cosmologies 2 to summarize several relevant recent observations that have implications for the formation of the earliest black holes and 3 to look into the future and assess the power of forthcoming observations to probe the physics of the first active galactic nuclei,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403225v1,Astronomy
primordial stars are likely to be very massive 30 msun form in isolation and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of their host dark matter halos we expect primordial stars to form in halos in the mass range 1061010 msun some of these early black holes formed at redshifts z10 could be the seed black hole for a significant fraction of the supermassive black holes found in galaxies in the local universe if the black hole descendants of the primordial stars exist their mergers with nearby supermassive black holes may be a prime candidate for long wavelength gravitational wave detectors we simulate formation and evolution of dark matter halos in lambdacdm universe we seed highredshift dark matter halos with early black holes and explore the merger history of the host halos and the implications of black holes kick velocities arising from their coalescence the central concentration of low mass early black holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of kms even such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the low mass black holes that were ejected compared to those still embedded in their parent halos therefore merger rates with central supermassive black holes in the largest halos may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude using analytical and illustrative cosmological nbody simulations we quantify the role of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal free stars with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609443v2,Astronomy
if the cosmological dark matter has a component made of small primordial black holes they may have a significant impact on the physics of the first stars and on the subsequent formation of massive black holes primordial black holes would be adiabatically contracted into these stars and then would sink to the stellar center by dynamical friction creating a larger black hole which may quickly swallow the whole star if these primordial black holes are heavier than sim 1022 rm g the first stars would likely live only for a very short time and would not contribute much to the reionization of the universe they would instead become 10 103 modot black holes which depending on subsequent accretion could serve as seeds for the supermassive black holes seen at high redshifts as well as those inside galaxies today,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0585v2,Astronomy
the relativistic accretion rate of dark matter by a black hole is revisited under the assumption that the phase space density indicator qrhoinftysigma3infty remains constant during the inflow the derived accretion rate can be higher up to five orders of magnitude than the classical accretion formula valid for nonrelativistic and noninteracting particles when typical dark halo conditions are considered for these typical conditions the critical point of the flow is located at distances of about 30150 times the horizon radius application of our results to black hole seeds hosted by halos issued from cosmological simulations indicate that dark matter contributes to no more than 10 of the total accreted mass confirming that the bolometric quasar luminosity is related to the baryonic accretion history of the black hole,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2041v1,Astronomy
if the cosmological dark matter is primarily in the form of an elementary particle which has cross section and mass for selfinteraction having a ratio similar to that of ordinary nuclear matter then seed black holes formed in stellar collapse will grow in a hubble time due to accretion of the dark matter to a mass range 106 109 solar masses furthermore the dependence of the final black hole mass on the galaxy velocity dispersion will be approximately as observed and the growth rate will show a time dependence consistent with observations other astrophysical consequences of collisional dark matter and tests of the idea are noted,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9912548v2,Astronomy
supermassive black holes smbhs are nowadays believed to reside in most local galaxies and the available data show an empirical correlation between bulge luminosity or stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass suggesting a single mechanism for assembling black holes and forming spheroids in galaxy halos the evidence is therefore in favour of a coevolution between galaxies black holes and quasars in cold dark matter cosmogonies smallmass subgalactic systems form first to merge later into larger and larger structures in this paradigm galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during their lifetime if every galaxy with a bulge hosts a smbh in its center and a local galaxy has been made up by multiple mergers then a black hole binary is a natural evolutionary stage the evolution of the supermassive black hole population clearly has to be investigated taking into account both the cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of smbhs and their hosts the seeds of smbhs have to be looked for in the early universe as very luminous quasars are detected up to redshift higher than z6 these black holes evolve then in a hierarchical fashion following the merger hierarchy of their host halos accretion of gas traced by quasar activity plays a fundamental role in determining the two parameters defining a black hole mass and spin a particularly intriguing epoch is the initial phase of smbh growth it is very challenging to meet the observational constraints at z6 if bhs are not fed at very high rates in their infancy,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602630v1,Astronomy
understanding how seed black holes grow into intermediate and supermassive black holes imbhs and smbhs respectively has important implications for the dutycycle of active galactic nuclei agn galaxy evolution and gravitational wave astronomy most studies of the cosmological growth and merger history of black holes have used semianalytic models and have concentrated on smbh growth in luminous galaxies using high resolution cosmological nbody simulations we track the assembly of black holes over a large range of final masses from seed black holes to smbhs over widely varying dynamical histories we used the dynamics of dark matter halos to track the evolution of seed black holes in three different gas accretion scenarios we have found that growth of sagittarius a size smbh reaches its maximum mass msmbh106msun at z6 through early gaseous accretion episodes after which it stays at near constant mass at the same redshift the dutycycle of the host agn ends hence redshift z6 marks the transition from an agn to a starburst galaxy which eventually becomes the milky way by tracking black hole growth as a function of time and mass we estimate that the imbh merger rate reaches a maximum of rmax55 yr1 at z11 from imbh merger rates we calculate nulx7 per milky way type galaxy per redshift in redshift range 2z6,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703540v1,Astronomy
it is argued that supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies most likely have grown coevally with their host dark matter halos a calculation based on pressschechter within this framework shows that the mean rate of accretion of matter onto such black holes varies from a value about 0003 of the eddington rate at the present epoch to a value around 008 at redshift 3 the bulk of agn evolution may be explained as a reflection of the diminishing rate of accretion of material onto galaxies the result is almost independent of mass of host dark matter halo and is only weakly dependent on the values of cosmological parameters at high redshifts z greater than about 5 black holes in galaxies would have been accreting close to the eddington limit which is likely to lead to galactic outflows being ubiquitous at those epochs,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506591v2,Astronomy
phase transitions in the early universe are prime settings for the production of primordial black holes since they can break the relatively quiescent homogeneity and isotropy of friedmannrobertsonwalker frw cosmologies these epochs of symmetry breaking moreover can affect the subsequent development of spacetime by changing the evolution of some frw parameters including the present age and density of the universe we discuss the relative importance of such effects on constraining mechanisms of black hole formation,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003062v1,Astronomy
we investigate the coupled formation and evolution of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes using stateoftheart hydrodynamic simulations of cosmological structure formation for the first time we selfconsistently follow the dark matter dynamics radiative gas cooling star formation as well as black hole growth and associated feedback processes starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the lambdacdm cosmology our modeling of the black hole physics is based on an approach we have developed in simulations of isolated galaxy mergers here we examine i the predicted global history of black hole mass assembly ii the evolution of the local black holehost mass correlations and iii the conditions that allow rapid growth of the first quasars and the properties of their hosts and descendants today we find a total black hole mass density in good agreement with observational estimates the black hole accretion rate density peaks at lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the star formation rate density but the ratio of black hole to stellar mass densities shows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts we find strong correlations between black hole masses and properties of the stellar systems agreeing well with the measured local mbhsigma and mbh m relationships but also suggesting dependent on the mass range a weak evolution with redshift in the normalization and the slope our simulations also produce massive black holes at high redshift due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions that collapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows these first supermassive bh systems however are not necessarily the most massive ones today since they are often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later abridged,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2269v1,Astronomy
we study a cosmological model in which the boson dark matter gradually condensates into dark energy negative pressure associated with the condensate yields the accelerated expansion of the universe and the rapid collapse of the smallest scale fluctuations into many black holes which become the seeds of the first galaxies the cycle of gradual sedimentation and rapid collapse of condensate repeats many times and selfregularizes the ratio of dark energy and dark matter to be order one,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403571v1,Astronomy
the physical basis of the modern cosmological inflationary models with baryosynthesis and nonbaryonic dark matter and energy implies such predictions of particle theory that in turn apply to cosmology for their test it makes physics of early universe ambiguous and particle model dependent the study of modern cosmology is inevitably linked with the probe for the new physics underlying it the particle model dependent phenomena such as unstable dark matter primordial black holes strong primordial inhomogeneities can play important role in revealing the true physical cosmology such phenomena having serious physical grounds and leading to new nontrivial cosmological scenarious should be taken into account in the data analysis of observational cosmology,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309703v1,Astronomy
this poster discusses a possible explanation for the relationship between the mass of the central supermassive black hole and the velocity dispersion in the bulge of the host galaxy we suppose that the black hole and the dark matter halo are forming simultaneously as matter falls in and a selfsimilar system then exists in which the mass and the velocities of the system evolve as powerlaw functions of time this leads naturally to a relationship between the black hole mass and the velocities in the halo which with a reasonable choice of cosmological parameters is in good agreement with the observed relationship we also confirm this relationship with more robust numerical results,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212278v2,Astronomy
we describe the model of protogalaxy formation around the cluster of primordial black holes with a minimum extension of standard cosmological model namely it is supposed that a mass fraction of the universe 103 is composed of the compact clusters of primordial relict black holes produced during the phase transitions in the early universe these clusters are the centers of the dark matter dm condensations as a result the protogalaxies with a mass 2x108msun form at the redshift z15 these induced protogalaxies contain the central black holes of mass 105msun and look like the dwarf spheroidal galaxies with a central density spike subsequent merging of the induced protogalaxies and ordinary dm haloes leads to the standard scenario of the large scale structure formation black holes merging gives the nowadays supermassive black holes and reproduces the observed correlations between their masses and velocity dispersions in the bulges,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412479v1,Astronomy
this work is related to different questions within cosmology the principal idea herein is to develop cosmological knowledge making use of the analyses of observational data in order to find the values of the matter density omegam and vacuum energy density omegalambda data fitting is carried out using two statistical methods chi2 and maximum likelihood the data analysis exhibits that a low density and flat universe is strongly favoured applying the omegam value found for clusters of galaxies we demonstrate that clusters have very little room for baryonic dark matter an upper limit to the small but nonnegligible sum of baryonic dark matter and galaxy mass can be estimated requiring the use of special statistics a toroidal black hole tbh study in contrast to the spherical black hole sbh shows that the tbh can be used as an important tool in explaining agn phenomena,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210253v1,Astronomy
we incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes into semianalytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter dominated universe we assume that supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers if two galaxies of comparable mass merge their central black holes coalesce and a few percent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a timescale of a few times 107 years with these simple assumptions our model not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies but also reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies the strong decline in the number density of quasars from z2 to z0 is due to the combination of three effects i a decrease in the merging rate ii a decrease in the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes and iii an increase in the timescale for gas accretion in a lcdm cosmology the predicted decline in the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of damped lymanalpha systems our results strongly suggest that the evolution of supermassive black holes quasars and starbursts is inextricably linked to the hierarchical buildup of galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9906493v1,Astronomy
if the dark matter in galactic halos is made up of compact macroscopic objects mo such as black holes with mmo mstars gravitational scattering will lead to kinematic heating of the stars observational constraints on the amount of heating in the disk of the milky way put upper limits on mmo ltorder 1063msun we find limits that are three orders of magnitude more stringent by examining the heating limits in low mass stellar systems where higher densities of dark matter and lower relative velocities disperse the stars in less than a billion years specifically the structure and kinematics of the local group member gr8 yield a limit of mmo ltorder 6times 103msun if the properties of the dark matter are universal these results preclude the dominance of dark matter constituents in the cosmologically interesting mass range sim 106msun and limit them to mmo ltorder 1037msun these results also rule out massive compact halo objects as significant contributors to the kinematic heating of the galactic disk,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9308022v1,Astronomy
dark matter in the universe consisting of macroscopic objects such as primordial black holes may cause gravitational lensing of distant objects the magnification associated with lensing will lead to additional scatter in the received flux from standard candles and too small an observed scatter could rule out compact dark matter entirely in this letter we show how the scatter in fluxes of distant type 1a supernovae could be used to distinguish between models with and without lensing by macroscopic dark matter the proposed snap project with sim 2400 supernovae in the range 01ls zls 17 should be able to identify models at 999 confidence if systematic errors are controlled note that this test is independent of any evolution of the mean supernova luminosity with redshift the variances of the current supernova cosmology project sample do not rule out compact lenses as dark matter formally they favour such a population but the significance is low and removal of a single faint supernova from the sample reverses the conclusion,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104221v2,Astronomy
the possibility that the masses of supermassive black holes sbhs correlate with the total gravitational mass of their host galaxy or the mass of the dark matter halo in which they presumably formed is investigated using a sample of 16 spiral and 20 elliptical galaxies the bulge velocity dispersion typically defined within an aperture of size less than 05 kpc is found to correlate tightly with the galaxys circular velocity the latter measured at distances from the galactic center at which the rotation curve is flat 20 to 80kpc by using the well known msigma relation for sbhs and a prescription to relate the circular velocity to the mass of the dark matter halo in a standard cdm cosmology the correlation between velocity dispersion and circular velocity is equivalent to one between sbh and halo masses such a correlation is found to be nonlinear with the ratio between the two masses decreasing from 2x104 for halos of 1014 solar masses to 105 for halos of 1012 solar masses preliminary evidence suggests that halos smaller than 5x1011 solar masses are increasingly less efficient perhaps unable at forming sbhs,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203469v2,Astronomy
the astrophysical processes that led to the formation of the first seed black holes and to their growth into the supermassive variety that powers bright quasars at redshift 6 are poorly understood in standard lcdm hierarchical cosmologies the earliest massive holes mbhs likely formed at redshift z15 at the centers of lowmass m5e5 solar masses dark matter minihalos and produced hard radiation by accretion fuvxray photons from such miniquasars may have permeated the universe more uniformly than euv radiation reduced gas clumping and changed the chemistry of primordial gas the role of accreting seed black holes in determining the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium depends on the amount of cold and dense gas that forms and gets retained in protogalaxies after the formation of the first stars the highest resolution nbody simulation to date of galactic substructure shows that subhalos below the atomic cooling mass were very inefficient at forming stars,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701394v1,Astronomy
we show that the luminosity function of the actively starforming lyman break galaxies and the bband quasar luminosity function at z 3 can be fit reasonably well with the mass function of collapsed galaxy scale dark matter haloes predicted by viable variants of hierarchical cold dark matter dominated cosmological models for lifetimes tq of the optically bright phase of qsos in the range 106 to 108 yr there is a strong correlation between tq and the required degree of nonlinearity in the relation between black hole and host halo mass such a nonlinear relation is motivated by suggesting that the mass of supermassive black holes may be limited by the backreaction of the emitted energy on the accretion flow in a selfgravitating disc this would imply a relation of black hole to halo mass of the form mrm bh propto vrm halo5 propto mrm halo53 and a typical duration of the optically bright qso phase of the order of the salpeter time sim 107 yr the high integrated local mass density of black holes inferred from recent kinematic determinations of black hole masses in nearby galaxies seem to indicate that the overall efficiency of supermassive black holes for producing blue light is lower than was previously assumed we discuss three possible accretion modes with low optical emission efficiency i accretion well above the eddington rate ii accretion obscured by dust and iii accretion below the critical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for a hubble time we further argue that accretion with low optical efficiency might be closely related to the origin of the hard xray background,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9809250v1,Astronomy
abridged the observed properties of supermassive black holes suggest a fundamental link between their assembly and the formation of their host spheroids we model the growth and activity of black holes in galaxies using lambdacdm cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by following the evolution of the baryonic mass component in galaxy potential wells we find that the observed steep relation between black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion mbh propto sigma4 is reproduced if the gas mass in bulges is linearly proportional to the black hole mass in this model black hole growth saturates because of the competition with starformation and feedback both of which determine the gas fraction available for accretion unless other processes also operate we predict that the mbhsigma relation is not set in primordial structures but is fully established at low redshifts z approxlt 2 and is shallower at earlier times we find that that central black hole masses are related to their dark matter halos simply via mbh mdm43 we assume that galaxies undergo a quasar phase with a typical lifetime tq 2times 107 yr and show that starformation regulated depletion of gas in spheroids can explain the decrease of the quasar population at redshift z3 in the optical blue band however with the simplest assumption of a redshift independent quasar lifetime the model overpredicts optical quasar numbers at high redshifts although it yields the observed evolution of number density of xray quasars over the redshift range 1 z 6 finally we find that the majority of black hole mass is assembled in galaxies by z 3 and that the black hole accretion rate density peaks in rough correspondence to the star formation rate density at z 45,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301586v2,Astronomy
recently it has been suggested that the majority of dark matter in the universe resides in the form of jupiter mass black holes distributed cosmologically this population makes itself apparent by microlensing high redshift quasars and introducing pronounced variability into their observed light curves while several arguments dismissing this hypothesis have been presented a conclusive observational test is alas sadly lacking in this paper we investigate the effect of a cosmologically distributed population of microlensing masses on galaxies at low to intermediate redshift the magnification of bright stars in these galaxies leads to small but observable fluctuations in their surface brightness the variability time scale for jupitermass lensing objects is of the order of a few months and this population may be detected through a future spacebased monitoring campaign of a field containing z sim 05 galaxies the monitoring of galactic surface brightness will provide an effective test of the nature of dark matter on cosmological scales,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0004037v1,Astronomy
progress in observational cosmology over the past five years has established that the universe is dominated dynamically by dark matter and dark energy both these new and apparently independent forms of matterenergy have properties that are inconsistent with anything in the existing standard model of particle physics and it appears that the latter must be extended we review what is known about dark matter and energy from their impact on the light of the night sky most of the candidates that have been proposed so far are not perfectly black but decay into or otherwise interact with photons in characteristic ways that can be accurately modelled and compared with observational data we show how experimental limits on the intensity of cosmic background radiation in the microwave infrared optical ultraviolet xray and gammaray bands put strong limits on decaying vacuum energy light axions neutrinos unstable weaklyinteracting massive particles wimps and objects like black holes our conclusion is that the dark matter is most likely to be wimps if conventional cosmology holds or higherdimensional sources if spacetime needs to be extended,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407207v1,Astronomy
ultralight scalar fields provide an interesting alternative to wimps as halo dark matter in this paper we consider the effect of embedding a supermassive black hole within such a halo and estimate the absorption probability and the accretion rate of dark matter onto the black hole we show that the accretion rate would be small over the lifetime of a typical halo and hence that supermassive central black holes can coexist with scalar field halos,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207493v2,Astronomy
we use semianalytic modeling on top of the millennium simulation to study the joint formation of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes our goal is to test scenarios in which black hole accretion and quasar activity are triggered by galaxy mergers and to constrain different models for the lightcurves associated with individual quasar events in the present work we focus on studying the spatial distribution of simulated quasars at all luminosities we find that the simulated quasar twopoint correlation function is fit well by a single powerlaw in the range 05 r 20 h1 mpc but its normalization is a strong function of redshift when we select only quasars with luminosities within the range typically accessible by todays quasar surveys their clustering strength depends only weakly on luminosity in agreement with observations this holds independently of the assumed lightcurve model since bright quasars are black holes accreting close to the eddington limit and are hosted by dark matter haloes with a narrow mass range of a few 1012 h1 msun therefore the clustering of bright quasars cannot be used to disentangle lightcurve models but such a discrimination would become possible if the observational samples can be pushed to significantly fainter limits overall our clustering results for the simulated quasar population agree rather well with observations lending support to the conjecture that galaxy mergers could be the main physical process responsible for triggering black hole accretion and quasar activity,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0003v2,Astronomy
aims we investigate the cosmological growth of dark halos and follow the consequences of coeval growth for the accretion history of associated supermassive black holes methods the pressschechter approximation is used to obtain an analytic expression for the mean rate of growth of dark matter halos dark halo accretion rates are compared with numerical work and the consequences for understanding agn evolution are described results the mean accretion rate onto dark matter halos is shown to have a simple analytic form that agrees with previous numerical work and that may easily be calculated for a wide range of halo mass redshift and cosmological parameters the result offers a significant improvement over published fitting formulae deduced from merger trees we then consider the growth of associated supermassive black holes and make a basic test of the simple hypothesis of pure coeval evolution pce in which on average black hole growth tracks dark halo growth we demonstrate that both the absolute value of the integrated agn bolometric luminosity density and its cosmological evolution derived from hard xray surveys are wellreproduced by pce excellent agreement is found at z 05 although the observed luminosity density drops by a factor 2 compared with pce by z0 black hole growth appears to decouple from halo growth at low redshifts and this may be related to the phenomenon of cosmic downsizing overall agn evolution appears either to be caused by or to be closely linked to the slowdown in the growth of cosmic structure we also discuss the mean eddington ratio averaged over all galaxies which is predicted to show strong evolution to higher values with redshift,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608202v2,Astronomy
massive black hole binaries with masses in the range 1e31e8 msun are expected to be the most powerful sources of gravitational radiation at mhz frequencies and hence are among the primary targets for the planned laser interferometer space antenna lisa we extend and refine our previous analysis sesana et al 2004 detailing the gravitational wave signal expected from a cosmological population of massive black hole binaries as done in our previous paper we follow the merger history of dark matter halos the dynamics of the massive black holes they host and their growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences in a lcdm cosmology stellar dynamical processes dominates the orbital evolution of black hole binaries at large separations while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii causing the final coalescence of the pairs we show that the gw signal from this population in a 3 year lisa observation will be resolved into approx 90 discrete events with sn5 among which approx 35 will be observed above threshold until coalescence these merging events involve relatively massive binaries m10e5 msun in the redshift range 2z6 the remaining approx 55 events come from higher redshift less massive binaries m5e3 msun at z6 and although their sn integrated over the duration of the observation can be substantial the final coalescence phase is at too high frequency to be directly observable by spacebased interferometers such as lisa lisa will be able to detect a fraction approx 90 of all the coalescences of massive black hole binaries occurring at z5 the residual confusion noise from unresolved massive black hole binaries is expected to be at least an order of magnitude below the estimated stochastic noise,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409255v2,Astronomy
a new scenario for the emission of highenergy gammarays from dark matter annihilation around massive black holes is presented a black hole can leave its parent halo by means of gravitational radiation recoil in a merger event or in the asymmetric collapse of its progenitor star a recoiled black hole which moves on an almostradial orbit outside the virial radius of its central halo in the cold dark matter background reaches its apapsis in a finite time near or at the apapsis passage a highdensity wake extending over a large radius of influence forms around the black hole it is shown that significant gammaray emission can result from the enhancement of neutralino annihilation in these wakes at its apapsis passage a black hole is shown to produce a flash of highenergy gammarays whose duration is determined by the mass of the black hole and the redshift at which it is ejected the ensemble of such black holes in the hubble volume is shown to produce a diffuse highenergy gammaray background whose magnitude is compared to the diffuse emission from dark matter haloes alone,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3321v4,Astronomy
if massive black holes constitute the dark matter in the halo surrounding the milky way the existence of low mass globular clusters in the halo suggests an upper limit to their mass mbh we use a combination of the impulse approximation and numerical simulations to constrain mbh lsim 103modot otherwise several of the halo globular clusters would be heated to disruption within one half of their lifetime taken at face value this constraint is three orders of magnitude stronger than the previous limit provided by disk heating arguments however since the initial mass function of clusters is unknown we argue that the real constraint is at most an order of magnitude weaker our results rule out cosmological scenarios such as versions of the primordial baryonic isocurvature fluctuation model which invoke the low jeans mass at early epochs to create a large population of black holes of mass sim 106modot,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9306004v1,Astronomy
i review scenarios for the assembly of supermassive black holes mbhs at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark matter halo merger tree monte carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a lcdm cosmology coupled to semianalytical recipes are a powerful tool to follow the merger history of halos and the dynamics and growth of the mbhs they host xray photons from miniquasars powered by intermediatemass seed holes may permeate the universe more uniformly than euv radiation make the lowdensity diffuse intergalactic medium warm and weakly ionized prior to the epoch of reionization breakthrough and set an entropy floor the spin distribution of mbhs is determined by gas accretion and is predicted to be heavily skewed towards fastrotating kerr holes to be already in place at early epochs and not to change significantly below redshift 5 decaying mbh binaries may shape the innermost central regions of galaxies and should be detected in significant numbers by lisa,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0410526v1,Astronomy
we consider the possibility that massive primordial black holes are the dominant form of dark matter black hole formation generates entropy fluctuations that adds a poisson noise to the matter power spectrum we use lymanalpha forest observations to constrain this poisson term in matter power spectrum then we constrain the mass of black holes to be less than few times 104 solar mass we also find that structures with less than 103 primordial black holes evaporate by now,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302035v1,Astronomy
since the original baryonic dark matter detection from quasar microlensing was first announced in 1996 substantial strides have been made in confirming the rapid microlensing signature in the q0957 system and in other gravitational lens systems the most rapid event recognized had a 1 amplitude and a 12hour duration interpretation of the rapid fluctuations has centered upon 3 offered explanations microlensing of fine quasar structure by a population of planet mass astronomical bodies in the lens galaxy orbiting bright structures in the accretion disc of the supermassive black hole of the quasar or dark clouds swarming around the luminous quasar source the observations particularly the equal positive and negative fluctuations seem to strongly favor the cosmological population of planetary mass objects in the lens galaxy of the several ideas advanced for the origin of such a population the most appealing seems to be their birth at the time of recombination 300000 years after the big bang,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406491v1,Astronomy
we study the impact of astrophysical processes on the gammaray background produced by the annihilation of dark matter particles in cosmological halos with particular attention to the consequences of the formation of supermassive black holes in scenarios where these objects form adiabatically from the accretion of matter on small seeds dark matter is first compressed into very dense spikes then its density progressively decreases due to annihilations and scattering off of stellar cusps with respect to previous analyses based on nonevolving halos the predicted annihilation signal is higher and significantly distorted at low energies reflecting the large contribution to the total flux from unevolved spikes at high redshifts the peculiar spectral feature arising from the specific redshift distribution of the signal would discriminate the proposed scenario from more conventional astrophysical explanations we discuss how this affects the prospects for detection and demonstrate that the gammaray background from dm annihilations might be detectable even in absence of a signal from the galactic center,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703236v2,Astronomy
minor mergers of galaxies are expected to be common in a hierarchical cosmology such as lambdacdm and have the potential to significantly affect galactic structure in this paper we dissect the casebycase outcome from a set of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accreting onto a massive elliptical galaxy we take care to explore cosmologically relevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models that include all three relevant dynamical components dark matter halos stellar bulges and central massive black holes the effects of several different parameters are considered including orbital energy and angular momentum satellite density and inner density profile satellitetohost mass ratio and presence of a black hole at the center of the host black holes play a crucial role in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts as satellites merging onto a host with a central black hole are more strongly disrupted than those merging onto hosts without black holes orbital parameters play an important role in determining the degree of disruption satellites on less bound or more eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on more bound or more circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentric passages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidal stripping in addition satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical galaxies are disrupted relatively easily while denser satellites can survive much better in the tidal field of the host over the range of parameters explored we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy can result in a broad variety of changes in both signs in the surface brightness profile and color of the central part of an elliptical galaxy,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608122v2,Astronomy
the evolution of the dark matter distribution at the galactic center is analyzed which is caused by the combination of gravitational scattering on galactic bulge stars and absorption by a supermassive black hole at the center of the bulge attention is focused on the boundary condition on the black hole it is shown that its form depends on the energy of dark matter particles the modified flux of dark matter particles onto the black hole is calculated estimates of the amount of dark matter absorbed show that the fraction of dark matter in the total mass of the black hole may be significant the density of dark matter at the central part of the bulge is calculated it is shown that recently observed gamma radiation from the galactic center can be attributed to the annihilation of dark matter with this density,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503712v1,Astronomy
we show that seeds for quasar black holes could have originated from the initial cosmological collapse of overdense regions with unusually small rotation the gas in these rare regions collapses into a compact disk that shrinks on a short viscous time scale using an analytical model we calculate the lowspin tail of the probability distribution of angular momenta for objects that collapse out of a gaussian random field of initial density perturbations the population of lowspin systems is significant for any viable power spectrum of primordial density perturbations most objects form just above the cosmological jeans mass sim 105 msun at high redshifts z10 in the standard cold dark matter cosmology the comoving density of 1067 msun objects with viscous evolution times shorter than 1067 years is about 103 h053 mpc3 comparable to the local density of bright galaxies the seed black holes tend to reside within larger mass systems that collapse later and supply the gas needed for the bright quasar activity,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9401016v2,Astronomy
quasars are the earliest objects known to exist we examine their origin in the context of popular models for structure formation in the universe we show that seeds for quasar black holes could have originated from the initial cosmological collapse of overdense regions with unusually small rotation most of these seeds have a mass of order 106 solar masses just above the cosmological jeans mass for cold dark matter cosmologies we find of order one seed black hole per bright galaxy after the galaxy forms the seeds inside its bulge sink to the center by dynamical friction we also describe a few empirical methods to study the properties of quasars and their environments these include probing quasar hosts through c ii emission finding quasar lifetimes from the proximity effect along two lines of sight and measuring the amplitude of clustering at high redshifts through the detection of lymanalpha clouds beyond the quasar redshift,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9501009v1,Astronomy

abridged we use high resolution cosmological nbody simulations to study the growth of intermediate to supermassive black holes from redshift 49 to zero we track the growth of black holes from the seeds of population iii stars to black holes in the range of 103 m 107 msun not quasars but rather imbh to lowmass smbhs these lower mass black holes are the primary observable for the laser interferometer space antenna lisa the largescale dynamics of the black holes are followed accurately within the simulation down to scales of 1 kpc thereafter we follow the merger analytically from the last dynamical friction phase to black hole coalescence we find that the merger rate of these black holes is r25 per year between 8 z 11 and r 10 per year at z3 before the merger occurs the incoming imbh may be observed with a next generation of xray telescopes as a ulx source with a rate of about 3 7 per year for 1 z 5 we develop an analytic prescription that captures the most important black hole growth mechanisms galaxy mergerdriven gas accretion and black hole coalescence using this we find that smbh at the center of milky way type galaxy was in place with most of its mass by z 47 and most of the growth was driven by gas accretion excited by major mergers hundreds of black holes have failed to coalesce with the smbh by z0 some with masses of 10000 msun orbiting within the dark matter halo with luminosities up to 30000 lsun these xray sources can easily be observed with chandra at 100 kpc,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3154v1,Astronomy
cosmological nucleosynthesis calculations imply that many of the baryons in the universe must be dark we discuss the likelihood that some of these dark baryons may reside in the discs or halos of galaxies if they were in the form of compact objects they would then be natural macho candidates in which case they are likely to be the remnants of a first generation of pregalactic or protogalactic population iii stars various candidates have been proposed for such remnants brown dwarfs red dwarfs white dwarfs neutron stars or black holes and we review the many types of observations including microlensing searches which can be used to constrain or exclude them,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0008028v1,Astronomy
this paper presents a study of quasisteady spherical accretion in the early universe before the formation of the first stars and galaxies the main motivation is to derive the basic formulas that will be used in a companion paper to calculate the accretion luminosity of primordial black holes and their effect on the cosmic ionization history the following cosmological effects are investigated the coupling of the gas to the cmb photon fluid ie compton drag hubble expansion and the growth of the dark matter halo seeded by the gravitational potential of the central point mass the gas equations of motion are solved assuming either a polytropic or an isothermal equation of state we consider the cases in which the accreting object is a point mass or a spherical dark matter halo with powerlaw density profile as predicted by the theory of secondary infall analytical solutions for the sonic radius and fitting formulas for the accretion rate are provided different accretion regimes exist depending on the mass of the accreting object if the black hole mass is smaller than 50100 msun gas accretion is unaffected by compton drag a point mass and an extended dark halo of equal mass accrete at the same rate if m5000 msun while smaller mass dark halos accrete less efficiently than the equivalent point mass for masses m3 x 104 msun the viscous term due to the hubble expansion becomes important and the assumption of quasisteady flow fails hence the steady bondi solutions transition to the timedependent selfsimilar solutions for cold cosmological infall,http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0864v1,Astronomy
the evolution of nonlinear density fluctuations around the jeans mass shortly after cosmological recombination is analyzed using a 3d hydrodynamicsdarkmatter code the cosmic background radiation cbr exerts compton friction on free electrons due to peculiar velocities the dynamics therefore depends strongly on the gas ionization history under a variety of ionization conditions and in systems with or without nonbaryonic components the baryons lose angular momentum efficiently and collapse to form a compact opticallythick object which would probably quickly evolve into a massive black hole attention is concentrated on elucidating some of the novel physical effects in early cosmological collapses but ways in which more realistic calculations might be made and in which the scenario could be incorporated into a more complete cosmogonic model are discussed,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9303004v1,Astronomy

we reconsider the possibility that the observed baryon asymmetry was generated by the evaporation of primordial black holes that dominated the early universe we present a simple derivation showing that the baryon asymmetry is insensitive to the initial black hole density and the cosmological model but is sensitive to the temperaturedependence of the cp and baryonviolating or leptonviolating interactions we also consider the possibility that black holes stop evaporating and form planckmass remnants that act as dark matter we show that primordial black holes cannot simultaneously account for both the observed baryon asymmetry and the remnant dark matter density unless the magnitude of cp violation is much greater than expected from most particle physics models finally we apply these results to ekpyroticcyclic models in which primordial black holes may form when branes collide we find that obtaining the observed baryon asymmetry is compatible with the other known constraints on parameters,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0703250v1,Astronomy
we investigate a hierarchical structure formation scenario in which galaxy stellar cores are created from the binding energy liberated by shrinking supermassive black hole smbh binaries the binary orbital decay heats the surrounding stars eroding a preexisting 1r2 stellar cusp we follow the merger history of dark matter halos and associated smbhs via cosmological monte carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present in a lcdm cosmology massive black holes get incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos sink to the center owing to dynamical friction accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive and form a binary system stellar dynamical processes drive the binary to harden and eventually coalesce a simple scheme is applied in which the loss cone is constantly refilled and a constant density core forms due to the ejection of stellar mass we find that a model in which the effect of the hierarchy of smbh interactions is cumulative and cores are preserved during galaxy mergers produces at the present epoch a correlation between the mass deficit the mass needed to bring a flat inner density profile to a 1r2 cusp and the mass of the nuclear smbh with a normalization and slope comparable to the observed relation models in which the mass displaced by the smbh binary is replenished after every major galaxy merger appear instead to underestimate the mass deficit observed in core galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304389v2,Astronomy

calculations of the rate of local primordial black hole explosions often assume that the pbhs can be highly concentrated into galaxies thereby weakening the pagehawking limit on the cosmological density of pbhs but if the pbhs are concentrated by a factor exceeding chcirc rcirc approx 4 times 105 where rcirc 85 kpc is the scale of the milky way then the steady emission from the pbhs in the halo will produce an anisotropic high latitude diffuse gamma ray intensity larger than the observed anisotropy this provides a limit on the ratedensity of evaporating pbhs of lesssim 04pc3yr1 which is more than 6 orders of magnitude lower than recent experimental limits however the weak observed anisotropic high latitude diffuse gamma ray intensity is consistent with the idea that the dark matter that closes the universe is planck mass remnants of evaporated black holes,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9509074v1,Astronomy
recent observations have shown that only a billion years after the big bang the universe was already lit up by bright quasars fuelled by the infall of gas onto supermassive black holes the masses of these early black holes are inferred from their luminosities to be 109 solar masses which is a difficult theoretical challenge to explain like nearby quasars the early objects could have formed in the central cores of massive host galaxies the formation of these hosts could be explained if like local large galaxies they were assembled gravitationally inside massive 1012 solar mass halos of dark matter there has hitherto been no observational evidence for the presence of these massive hosts or their surrounding halos here we show that the cosmic gas surrounding each halo must respond to its strong gravitational pull where absorption by the infalling hydrogen produces a distinct spectral signature that signature can be seen in recent data,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0209515v4,Astronomy

we show that a spherical electroweak domain wall is formed around a small black hole and this is a general property of the hawking radiation in the vacuum of the standard model the wall appears not only for the first order phase transition in the electroweak theory but also for the second order one because the black hole heats up its neighborhood locally by the hawking radiation in any case we propose a model for unifying the origin of the baryon number and the cold dark matter in our universe by using properties of the primordial black hole with a mass of several hundred kilograms the interaction between our wall and the hawkingradiatedparticles can create a baryon number which is proportional to the mass of the black hole as well as the cp broken phase in the extension of the standard model our model can explain both the baryonentropy ratio bs sim 1010 and the energy density of the dark matter provided that the following three conditions are satisfied i the primordial black holes dominate in the early universe ii the cp broken phase in the wall is in the order of one and iii any black hole leaves a stable remnant with a planck mass after its evaporation our model also predicts a cosmological graviton background with a peakenergy 120 sim 280 ev in the present universe,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0104160v1,Astronomy

galaxies are complex systems the evolution of which apparently results from the interplay of dynamics star formation chemical enrichment and feedback from supernova explosions and supermassive black holes the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation holds that galaxies are assembled from smaller pieces through numerous mergers of cold dark matter the properties of an individual galaxy should be controlled by six independent parameters including mass angularmomentum baryonfraction age and size as well as by the accidents of its recent haphazard merger history here we report that a sample of galaxies that were first detected through their neutral hydrogen radiofrequency emission and are thus free of optical selection effects shows five independent correlations among six independent observables despite having a wide range of properties this implies that the structure of these galaxies must be controlled by a single parameter although we cannot identify this parameter from our dataset such a degree of organisation appears to be at odds with hierarchical galaxy formation a central tenet of the cold dark matter paradigm in cosmology,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1554v1,Astronomy
there have been proposals that primordial black hole remnants bhrs are the dark matter but the idea is somewhat vague recently we argued that the generalized uncertainty principle gup may prevent black holes from evaporating completely in a similar way that the standard uncertainty principle prevents the hydrogen atom from collapsing we further noted that the hybrid inflation model provides a plausible mechanism for production of large numbers of small black holes combining these we suggested that the dark matter might be composed of plancksize bhrs in this paper we briefly review these arguments and discuss the reheating temperature as a result of black hole evaporation,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0305025v1,Astronomy

abridged this is the second of two companion papers on the interior structure of selfsimilar accreting charged black holes in the first paper the black hole was allowed to accrete only a single fluid of charged baryons in this second paper the black hole is allowed to accrete in addition a neutral fluid of almost noninteracting dark matter relativistic streaming between outgoing baryons and ingoing dark matter leads to mass inflation near the inner horizon when enough dark matter has been accreted that the center of mass frame near the inner horizon is ingoing then mass inflation ceases and the fluid collapses to a central singularity a null singularity does not form on the cauchy horizon although the simultaneous presence of ingoing and outgoing fluids near the inner horizon is essential to mass inflation reducing one or other of the ingoing dark matter or outgoing baryonic streams to a trace relative to the other stream makes mass inflation more extreme not the other way round as one might naively have expected consequently if the dark matter has a finite crosssection for being absorbed into the baryonic fluid then the reduction of the amount of ingoing dark matter merely makes inflation more extreme the interior mass exponentiating more rapidly and to a larger value before mass inflation ceases however if the dark matter absorption crosssection is effectively infinite at high collision energy so that the ingoing dark matter stream disappears completely then the outgoing baryonic fluid can drop through the cauchy horizon in all cases the solutions do not depend on what happens in the infinite past or future we discuss in some detail the physical mechanism that drives mass inflation,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0411062v2,Astronomy
we study the gas metallicity of quasar hosts using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the lambdacold dark matter model galaxy formation in the simulations is coupled with a prescription for black hole activity enabling us to study the evolution of the metal enrichment in quasar hosts and hence explore the relationship between starspheroid formation and black hole growthactivity we find a steep radial metallicity gradient in quasar host galaxies with gas metallicities close to solar values in the outer parts but becoming supersolar in the center the hosts of the rare bright quasars at z56 have star formation rates of several hundred solar masses per year and halo masses of order 1012 solar masses already at these redshifts they have supersolar z 23 solar central metallicities with a mild dependence of metallicity on luminosity consistent with observed trends the mean value of metallicity is sensitive to the assumed quasar lifetime providing a useful new probe of this parameter we find that lifetimes from 1074x107yr are favored by comparison to observational data in both the models and observations the rate of evolution of the mean quasar metallicity as a function of redshift is generally flat out to z 45 beyond the observed redshift range and out to redshift z 68 we predict a slow decline of the mean central metallicity towards solar and slightly subsolar values as we approach the epoch of the first significant star formation activity,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309533v2,Astronomy
a central supermassive black hole smbh with a mass 106109 modot appears to be a common feature in nearby galaxies and the likely power source in quasars and active galactic nuclei we demonstrate that the formation of a central black hole is a natural and inevitable consequence of the gravothermal catastrophe in a selfinteracting dark matter sidm halo through gravothermal evolution driven by collisional relaxation an sidm halo will form a massive inner core whose density and velocity dispersion will increase secularly in time eventually the inner core arrives at a relativistic radial instability and undergoes dynamical collapse to a black hole the initial mass of the black hole will be 108106 of the total mass of the halo we show that if at formation the overdensity in the sidm halo is not too large smbhs in the observed mass range can form directly in very massive halos following core collapse alternatively with large overdensities moderate mass halos undergo core collapse to form central seed black holes of intermediate mass and these holes can then merge andor accrete to reach the smbh range forming smbhs by core collapse in sidm halos requires no baryons no prior epoch of star formation and no other mechanism of forming black holes seeds,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0111176v3,Astronomy
we simulate the ionization environment of z 20 luminous objects formed within the framework of the current cdm cosmology and compute their uv escape fraction these objects are likely single very massive stars that are copious uv emitters we present analytical estimates as well as onedimensional radiation hydrodynamical calculations of the evolution of these first hii regions in the universe the initially dtype ionization front evolves to become rtype within lesssim 105 yrs at a distance sim1 pc this ionization front then completely overruns the halo accelerating an expanding shell of gas outward to velocities in excess of 30 km s1 about ten times the escape velocity of the confining dark matter halo we find that the evolution of the hii region depends only weakly on the assumed stellar ionizing luminosities consequently most of the gas surrounding the first stars will leave the dark halo whether or not the stars produce supernovae if they form the first massive seed black holes these are unlikely to accrete within a hubble time after they formed until they are incorporated into larger dark matter halos that contain more gas because these ifronts exit the halo on timescales much shorter than the stars main sequence lifetimes their host halos have uv escape fractions of gtrsim 095 fixing an important parameter for theoretical studies of cosmological hydrogen reionization,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310283v2,Astronomy
model of supermassive black holes formation inside the clusters of primordial black holes is developed namely it is supposed that some mass fraction of the universe 103 is composed of the compact clusters of primordial relic black holes produced during phase transitions in the early universe these clusters are the centers of dark matter condensation we model the formation of protogalaxies with masses about 2108msun at the redshift z15 these induced protogalaxies contain central black holes with mass 105msun and look like dwarf spheroidal galaxies with central density spike the subsequent merging of induced protogalaxies and ordinary dark matter haloes corresponds to the standard hierarchical clustering scenario of largescale structure formation the coalescence of primordial black holes results in formation of supermassive black holes in the galactic centers as a result the observed correlation between the masses of central black holes and velocity dispersion in the galactic bulges is reproduced,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0885v1,Astronomy
there have been proposals that primordial black hole remnants bhrs are the dark matter but the idea is somewhat vague we argue here first that the generalized uncertainty principle gup may prevent black holes from evaporating completely in a similar way that the standard uncertainty principle prevents the hydrogen atom from collapsing secondly we note that the hybrid inflation model provides a plausible mechanism for production of large numbers of small black holes combining these we suggest that the dark matter might be composed of plancksize bhrs and discuss the possible constraints and signatures associated with this notion,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303349v2,Astronomy
in cuspy atmospheres jets driven by supermassive black holes bhs offset radiative cooling the jets fire episodically but often enough that the cuspy atmosphere does not move very far towards a cooling catastrophe in the intervals of jet inactivity the ability of energy released on the subparsec scale of the bh to balance cooling on scales of several tens of kiloparsecs arises through a combination of the temperature sensitivity of the accretion rate and the way in which the radius of jet disruption varies with ambient density accretion of hot gas does not significantly increase bh masses which are determined by periods of rapid bh growth and star formation when cold gas is briefly abundant at the galactic centre hot gas does not accumulate in shallow potential wells as the universe ages deeper wells form and eventually hot gas accumulates this gas soon prevents the formation of further stars since jets powered by the bh prevent it from cooling and it mops up most cold infalling gas before many stars can form thus bhs set the upper limit to the masses of galaxies the formation of lowmass galaxies is inhibited by a combination of photoheating and supernovadriven galactic winds working in tandem these mechanisms can probably explain the profound difference between the galaxy luminosity function and the mass function of dark halos expected in the cold dark matter cosmology,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407238v1,Astronomy
the tight correlation between galaxy bulges and their central black hole masses likely emerges in a phase of rapid collapse and starburst at high redshift due to the balance of gravity on gas with the feedback force from starbursts and the wind from the black hole the average gravity on per unit mass of gas is 2 x 1010 msec2 during the star burst phase this level of gravity could come from the real r1 cusps of cold dark matter cdm halos but the predicted gravity would have a large scatter due to dependence on cosmological parameters and formation histories better agreement is found with the gravity from the scalar field in some covariant versions of mond which can create the mirage of a newtonian effective dark halo of density pi r1 near the center where the characteristic surface density pi130alpha1 msun pc2 and alpha is a fundamental constant of order unity fixed by the lagrangian of the covariant theory if neglecting environmental effects we show with a toy analytical model and a hydrodynamical simulation that a constant background gravity due to mondteves scalar field implies a critical pressure synchronizing starbursts and the formation of galaxy bulges and ellipticals a universal threshold for the formation of the brightest regions of galaxies in a mondian universe suggests that the central bhs bulges and ellipticals would respect tight correlations like the mbulgembhsigma relations in general mond tends to produce tight correlations in galaxy properties because its effective halo has less freedom and scatter than cdm halos,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1073v3,Astronomy

we study the crosscorrelation between quasars and galaxies by embedding models for the formation and evolution of the two populations in cosmological nbody simulations we adopt the quasar evolution model of kauffmann haehnelt 2000 in which supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers we define the bias parameter bqg as the ratio of the crosscorrelation function xiqg to the galaxy autocorrelation function xigg on scales larger than 1 h1 mpc the values of bqg predicted by our models at low redshift depend very little on galaxy selection they measure the characteristic mass of the dark matter halos that host quasars and can be used to estimate the typical quasar lifetime in current redshift surveys such measurements will constrain the lifetimes of low z quasars more accurately than measurements of the quasar autocorrelation function because galaxies have much higher space densities than quasars on scales smaller than 1 h1 mpc the main contribution to xiqg comes from quasargalaxy pairs in the same dark matter halo the amplitude of xiqg depends both on the location of the host galaxy and on the density profile of other galaxies within the halo as a result measurements on these scales yield information about the processes responsible for fuelling super massive black holes at high redshifts our models predict that quasars of fixed luminosity are located in less massive halos than at low redshift they are therefore less biased relative to galaxies of given luminosity or stellar mass we have used the simulations to calculate the evolution of the quasar auto correlation function we find that models with quasar lifetimes in the range 106107 years provide a good match to the results of the 2df qso survey,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108275v1,Astronomy
using very long baseline interferometry we have searched a sample of 300 compact radio sources for examples of multiple imaging produced by gravitational lensing no multiple images were found with separations in the angular range 1550 milliarcsec this null result allows us to place a limit on the cosmological abundance of intergalactic supermassive compact objects in the mass range sim 106 to sim 108modot such objects cannot make up more than sim 1 of the closure density 95 confidence a uniformly distributed population of supermassive black holes forming soon after the big bang do not therefore contribute significantly to the dark matter content of the universe,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0101328v1,Astronomy

the first luminous objects in the concordance cosmology form by molecular hydrogen cooling in dark matter dominated halos of masses 106 msun we use eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulations to demonstrate that in the presence of a large soft ultraviolet radiation background molecular hydrogen is the dominant coolant even for very large radiation backgrounds the halo masses that cool and collapse are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the halos that cool via atomic hydrogen line cooling the abundance of cooling halos and the cosmic mass fraction contained within them depends exponentially on this critical mass scale consequently the majority of current models of cosmological reionization chemical evolution supermassive black hole formation and galaxy formation underestimate the number of star forming progenitors of a given system by orders of magnitude at the highest redshifts this disagreement is largest we also show that even in the absence of residual electrons collisional ionization in central shocks create a sufficient amount of electrons to form molecular hydrogen and cool the gas in halos of virial temperatures far below the atomic cooling limit,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.2059v2,Astronomy
high resolution deep imaging surveys are instrumental in setting constraints on semianalytical structure formation models in cold dark matter cdm cosmologies we show here that the lack of unresolved bband dropouts with v 25 mag in the hubble deep field hdf appears to be inconsistent with the expected number of quasars if massive black holes form with a constant universal efficiency in all cdm halos to reconcile the models with the data a mechanism is needed that suppresses the formation of quasars in halos with circular velocities vcirc 5075 kms this feedback naturally arises due to the photoionization heating of the gas by the uv background we consider several alternative effects that would help reduce the quasar number counts and find that these can not alone account for the observed lack of detections if reddening by dust can be neglected at early epochs consistency with the optical data also requires that the luminous extent of dwarf galaxies at high redshifts be larger than a few percent of the virial radii of their dark matter halos in order not to overpredict the number of pointlike bband dropouts future deep observations in the j and h bands with nicmos might reveal several z 5 objects per field or provide even stronger constraints on the models than existing b v and i data,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805258v1,Astronomy
using the results of recent optical surveys we conclude that the it nondetection of quasars down to faint magnitudes implies a significant flattening of the high redshift z6 optical active galactic nuclei agn luminosity function for m1450247 we find that all the data are consistent with a faintend slope for the optical agn luminosity function of beta22 and beta28 at the 90 and 99 confidence level respectively flatter than the brightend slope of beta 32 we also show that xray deep surveys have probed even fainter magnitudes than the optical ones yielding more significant constraints on the shallow faintend slope of the optical luminosity function the inclusion of type ii agn candidates detected in the chandra deep fields hints towards an higher normalization for the total agn luminosity function if these sources lie at 5z 65 we then discuss simple theoretical models of agn formation and evolution in the context of cold dark matter cosmology the comparison with the total agn luminosity function favors a redshiftdependent relation between black hole and dark matter halo masses of the type mbhm haloalpha with 13 alpha 17 compatible with independent studies from statistical analysis and rotation curve measurements finally we compute the quasar contribution to reionization to be 9 at z6 up to 30 when integrated within 55 z65 significantly smaller than that from galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701515v2,Astronomy
we report on a calculation of the growth of the mass of supermassive black holes at galactic centers from dark matter and eddington limited baryonic accretion assuming that dark matter halos are made of fermions and harbor compact degenerate fermi balls of masses from 103modot to 106modot we find that dark matter accretion can boost the mass of seed black holes from about sim 5modot to 1034modot black holes which then grow by eddington limited baryonic accretion to supermassive black holes of 106 9modot we then show that the formation of the recently detected supermassive black hole of 3times 109modot at a redshift of z 641 in the quasar sdss j114816645251503 could be understood if the black hole completely consumes the degenerate fermi ball and then grows by eddington limited baryonic accretion in the context of this model we constrain the dark matter particle masses to be within the range from 12 rm kevc2 to about 450 rm kevc2 finally we investigate the black hole growth dependence on the formation time of the seed bh and on the mass of the seed bh we find that in order to fit the observed data point of mbh sim 3 times 109modot and z sim 641 dark matter accretion cannot start later than about 2 times 108 years and the seed bh cannot be greater than about 104modot our results are in full agreement with the wmap observations that indicate that the first onset of star formation might have occurred at a redshift of z sim 15 20 for other models of dark matter particle masses corresponding constraints may be derived from the growth of black holes in the center of galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403511v3,Astronomy

the transition between the nearly smooth initial state of the universe and its clumpy state today occurred during the epoch when the first stars and lowluminosity quasars formed for cold dark matter cosmologies the radiation produced by the first baryonic objects is expected to ionize the universe at z1020 and consequently suppress by 10 the amplitude of microwave anisotropies on angular scales 10 degrees future microwave anisotropy satellites will be able to detect this signature the production and mixing of metals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the metallicity 1 solar found in the intergalactic medium at redshifts z5 the next generation space telescope ngst will be able to image directly the first light from these stars with its njy sensitivity ngst is expected to detect 103 star clusters per square arcminute at z10 the brightest sources however might be early quasars the infrared flux from an eddington luminosity 106 solar mass black hole at z10 is 10 njy at 1 micron easily detectable with ngst the time it takes a black hole with a radiative efficiency of 10 to double its mass amounts to more than a tenth of the hubble time at z10 and so a fair fraction of all systems which harbor a central black hole at this redshift would appear active the redshift of all sources can be determined from the lymanlimit break in their spectrum which overlaps with the ngst wavelength regime 135 micron for 10z35 absorption spectra of the first generation of star clusters or quasars would reveal the reionization history of the universe the intergalactic medium might show a significant opacity to infrared sources at z10 due to dust produced by the first supernovae,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9704290v1,Astronomy
although the population of luminous quasars rises and falls over a period of 109 years the typical lifetime of individual quasars is uncertain by several orders of magnitude we show that quasar clustering measurements can substantially narrow the range of possible lifetimes with the assumption that luminous quasars reside in the most massive host halos if quasars are longlived then they are rare phenomena that are highly biased with respect to the underlying dark matter while if they are shortlived they reside in more typical halos that are less strongly clustered for a given quasar lifetime we calculate the minimum host halo mass by matching the observed space density of quasars using the pressschechter approximation we use the results of mo white to calculate the clustering of these halos and hence of the quasars they contain as a function of quasar lifetime a lifetime of tq 4 x 107 years the efolding timescale of an eddington luminosity black hole with accretion efficiency eps01 corresponds to a quasar correlation length r0 10 mpch in lowdensity cosmological models at z23 this value is consistent with current clustering measurements but these have large uncertainties highprecision clustering measurements from the 2df and sloan quasar surveys will test our key assumption of a tight correlation between quasar luminosity and host halo mass and if this assumption holds then they should determine tq to a factor of three or better an accurate determination of the quasar lifetime will show whether supermassive black holes acquire most of their mass during highluminosity accretion and it will show whether the black holes in the nuclei of typical nearby galaxies were once the central engines of highluminosity quasars,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0002384v2,Astronomy
we study the expected distribution of massive black hole mbh spins and its evolution with cosmic time in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation theories our model uses monte carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy in a lcdm cosmology coupled to semianalytical recipes to follow the merger history of dark matter halos the dynamics of the mbhs they host and their growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences the coalescence of comparable mass holes increases the spin of mbhs while the capture of smaller companions in randomlyoriented orbits acts to spin holes down we find that given the distribution of mbh binary mass ratios in hierarchical models binary coalescences alone do not lead to a systematic spinup or spindown of mbhs with time the spin distribution retains memory of its initial conditions by contrast because of the bardeenpetterson effect gas accretion via a thin disk tends to spin holes up even if the direction of the spin axis changes randomly in time in our models accretion dominates over black hole captures and efficiently spins holes up the spin distribution is heavily skewed towards fastrotating kerr holes is already in place at early epochs and does not change much below redshift 5 if accretion is via a thin disk about 70 of all mbhs are maximally rotating and have radiative efficiencies approaching 30 assuming a standard spinefficiency conversion even in the conservative case where accretion is via a geometrically thick disk about 80 of all mbhs have spin parameters am 08 and accretion efficiencies 12 rapidly spinning holes with high radiative efficiencies may satisfy constraints based on comparing the local mbh mass density with the mass density inferred from luminous quasars soltans argument,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0410342v1,Astronomy

the high sensitivity of upcoming spacebased gravitational wave detectors suggests the possibility that if halo dark matter were composed of primordial black holes pbhs with mass between 1016 g and 1020 g the gravitational interaction with detector test masses will lead to a detectable pulselike signal during the flyby for an improved version of the laser interferometer space antenna with a reduced acceleration noise at the lowend of its frequency spectrum we find an event rate with signaltonoise ratios greater than 5 of sim a few per decade involving black holes of mass sim 1017 g the detection rate improves significantly for second generation space based interferometers that are currently envisioned though these events must be distinguished from those involving perturbations due to nearearth asteroids while the presence of primordial black holes below a mass of sim 1016 g is now constrained based on the radiation released during their evaporation the gravitational wave detectors will extend the study of pbhs to a several orders of magnitude higher masses,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405216v1,Astronomy

the existence of black holes remains open to doubt until other conceivable options are excluded with this motivation we consider a model of a compact star in which most of the mass consists of dark particles of some kind and a small fraction of the mass is in the form of ordinary nucleonic gas the gas does not interact with the dark matter other than via gravity but collects at the center as a separate fermionic fluid component depending on whether the dark mass is made of fermions or bosons the objects may be called fermionfermion stars or bosonfermion stars respectively for appropriate choices of the mass of the dark matter particles these objects are viable models of black hole candidates in xray binaries we consider models with a dark mass of 10 solar masses and a range of gas mass from 106 to nearly one solar mass and analyse the bursting properties of the models when they accrete gas we show that all the models would experience thermonuclear type i xray bursts at appropriate mass accretion rates since no type i bursts have been reported from black hole candidates the models are ruled out the case for identifying black hole candidates in xray binaries as true black holes is thus strengthened,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401549v1,Astronomy
the evolution of dark matter in central areas of galaxies is considered the milky way is taken as an example it is driven by scattering off of dark matter particles by bulge stars their absorption by the supermassive black hole and selfannihilation this process is described by diffusion equation in the phase space of energy and angular momentum the equation was integrated for several different models of initial dark matter distribution and using various assumptions about the dynamical factors it turns out that because the milky way center is rather dynamically old 5 relaxation times tr the difference in initial conditions almost vanishes the density attains a nearly universal profile and the gammaray flux from dark matter annihilation lies in rather narrow range which enables more robust determination of the dark matter parameters by present time the mass of dark matter inside the black hole sphere of influence r2 pc has been reduced approximately twice mostly because of heating by stars it is shown that the dynamics of dark matter for ttr is determined mainly by stars outside the sphere of influence,http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0002v2,Astronomy

we discuss the possibilities for primordial black holes pbhs to grow via the accretion of dark matter in agreement with previous works we find that accretion during the radiationdominated era does not lead to a significant mass increase however during matterdomination pbhs may grow by up to two orders of magnitude in mass through the acquisition of large dark matter halos we discuss the possibility of pbhs being an important component in dark matter halos of galaxies as well as their potential to explain the ultraluminous xray sources ulxs observed in nearby galactic disks we point out that although pbhs are ruled out as the dominant component of dark matter there is still a great deal of parameter space open to them playing a role in the modernday universe for example a primordial halo population of pbhs each at 1025 modot making up 01 of the dark matter grow to 1045 modot via the accumulation of dark matter halos to account for sim 10 of the dark matter mass by a redshift of z approx 30 these intermediate mass black holes may then light up when passing through molecular clouds becoming visible as ulxs at the present day or they may form the seeds for supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608642v1,Astronomy
abridged the thermal state of the intracluster medium results from a competition between gas cooling and heating the heating comes from two distinct sources gravitational heating from the collapse of the dark matter halo and thermal input from galaxyblack hole formation however a long standing problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and eulerian mesh codes predict different results even when cooling and galaxyblack hole heating are switched off clusters formed in sph simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles while those formed in mesh simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach such low entropies since the cooling rate is closely connected to the minimum entropy of the gas the differences are of potentially key importance in this paper we investigate the origin of this discrepancy by comparing simulations run using the gadget2 sph code and the flash adaptive eulerian mesh code we show that the discrepancy arises during the idealised merger of two clusters the difference is not sensitive to the resolution of our simulations nor is it is due differences in the gravity solvers galilean noninvariance of the mesh code or an effect of unsuitable artificial viscosity in the sph code instead we find that the difference is inherent to the treatment of eddies and fluid instabilities these are suppressed in the sph simulations while the cluster mergers generate strong vortices in the mesh simulations that efficiently mix the fluid and erase the low entropy gas consequently particles in the sph simulations retain a close connection to their initial entropy while this connection is much weaker in the mesh simulations we discuss the potentially profound implications of these results,http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1750v2,Astronomy

in this letter we study the process of hawking radiation of a black hole assuming the existence of a limiting physical curvature scale the particular model is constructed using the limiting curvature hypothesis lch and in the context of twodimensional dilaton gravity the black hole solution exhibits properties of the standard schwarzschild solution at large values of the radial coordinate however near the center the black hole is nonsingular and the metric becomes that of de sitter spacetime the hawking temperature is calculated using the method of complex paths we find that such black holes radiate eternally and never completely evaporate the final state is an eternally radiating relic near the fundamental scale which should make a viable dark matter candidate we briefly comment on the black hole information loss problem and the production of such black holes in collider experiments,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210016v4,Astronomy
in the standard flat cosmological constant lambda cold dark matter cdm cosmology a model of two populations of lens halos for strong gravitational lensing can reproduce the results of the jodrellbank vla astrometric survey jvas and the cosmic lens allsky survey class radio survey in such a model lensing probabilities are sensitive to three parameters the concentration parameter c1 the cooling mass scale mmathrmc and the value of the cdm power spectrum normalization parameter sigma8 the value ranges of these parameters are constrained by various observations however we found that predicted lensing probabilities are also quite sensitive to the flux density brightness ratio qmathrmr of the multiple lensing images which has been in fact a very important selection criterion of a sample in any lensing survey experiments we reexamine the above mentioned model by considering the flux ratio and galactic central super massive black holes smbhs in flat lowdensity cosmological models with different cosmic equations of state omega and find that the predicted lensing probabilities without considering qmathrmr are overestimated a low value of qmathrmr can be compensated by raising the cooling mass scale mmathrmc in fitting the predicted lensing probabilities to jvasclass observations in order to determine the cosmic equation of state omega the uncertainty in mmathrmc must be resolved the effects of smbhs cannot be detected by strong gravitational lensing method when qmathrmrleq 10,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0306445v3,Astronomy

we consider a class of models for the redshift evolution between 0lsim z lsim 4 of the observed optical and xray quasar luminosity functions lfs with the following assumptions i the massfunction of dark matter halos follows the pressschechter theory ii the black hole bh mass scales linearly with the halo mass iii quasars have a constant universal lifetime and iv a thin accretion disk provides the optical luminosity of quasars while the xrayoptical flux ratio is calibrated from a sample of observed quasars the mass accretion rate dotm onto quasar bhs is a free parameter of the models that we constrain using the observed lfs the accretion rate dot m inferred from either the optical or xray data under these assumptions generally decreases as a function of cosmic time from z simeq 4 to z simeq 0 we find that a comparable accretion rate is inferred from the xray and optical lf only if the xrayoptical flux ratio decreases with bh mass near zsimeq 0 dot m drops to substantially subeddington values at which advectiondominated accretion flows adafs exist such a decline of dot m possibly followed by a transition to radiatively inefficient adafs could explain both the absence of bright quasars in the local universe and the faintness of accreting bhs at the centers of nearby galaxies we argue that a decline of the accretion rate of the quasar population is indeed expected in cosmological structure formation models,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9810426v2,Astronomy
the importance of angular momentum in regulating the sizes of galactic disks and by this their star formation history is highlighted tidal torques and accretion of satellites in principle provide enough angular momentum to form disks with sizes that are in agreement with observations however three major problems have been identified that challenge cold dark matter theory and affect models of galaxy evolution 1 too much angular momentum is transferred from the gas to the dark halos during infall leading to disks with scale lengths that are too small 2 bulgeless disks require more specific angular momentum than is generated cosmologically even if gas would not lose angular momentum during infall 3 gravitational torques and hierarchical merging produce a specific angular momentum distribution that does not match the distribution required to form exponential disks naturally some gas has exceptionally high angular momentum leading to extended outer disks while another large gas fraction will contain very little specific angular momentum and is expected to fall into the galactic center forming a massive and dominant bulge component any selfconsistent theory of galaxy formation will require to provide solutions to these questions selective mass loss of lowangularmomentum gas in an early phase of galaxy evolution currently seems to be the most promising scenario such a process would have a strong affect on the early protogalactic evolution phase the origin and evolution of galactic morphologies and link central properties of galaxies like the origin of central massive black holes with their global structure,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409540v1,Astronomy

recently rapid observational and theoretical progress has established that black holes bhs play a decisive role in the formation and evolution of individual galaxies as well as galaxy groups and clusters in particular there is compelling evidence that bhs vigorously interact with their surroundings in the central regions of galaxy clusters indicating that any realistic model of cluster formation needs to account for these processes this is also suggested by the failure of previous generations of hydrodynamical simulations without bh physics to simultaneously account for the paucity of strong cooling flows in clusters the slope and amplitude of the observed cluster scaling relations and the highluminosity cutoff of central cluster galaxies here we use highresolution cosmological simulations of a large cluster and group sample to study how bhs affect their host systems we focus on two specific properties the halo gas fraction and the xray luminositytemperature scaling relation both of which are notoriously difficult to reproduce in selfconsistent hydrodynamical simulations we show that bh feedback can solve both of these issues bringing them in excellent agreement with observations without alluding to the cooling only solution that produces unphysically bright central galaxies by comparing a large sample of simulated agnheated clusters with observations our new simulation technique should make it possible to reliably calibrate observational biases in cluster surveys thereby enabling various highprecision cosmological studies of the dark matter and dark energy content of the universe,http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0494v2,Astronomy

we investigate a model in which galactic nuclei form via the coalescence of preexisting stellar systems containing supermassive black holes merger simulations are carried out using nbody algorithms that can follow the formation and decay of a blackhole binary and its effect on the surrounding stars down to subparsec scales our initial stellar systems have steep central density cusps similar to those in lowluminosity elliptical galaxies formation of a blackhole binary transfers energy to the stars and lowers the central density continued decay of the binary creates a 1r density cusp similar to those observed in bright elliptical galaxies with a break radius that extends well beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the black holes the decay of the black hole binary is followed over a factor of 20 in separation after formation of a hard binary considerably farther than in previous simulations we see almost no dependence of the binarys decay rate on number of particles in the simulation contrary to earlier studies in which a lower initial density of stars led to a more rapid depletion of the binarys loss cone we nevertheless argue that the decay of a black hole binary in a real galaxy would be expected to stall at separations of 0011 pc unless some additional mechanism is able to extract energy from the binary our results support a picture in which the observed dependence of nuclear cusp slope on galaxy luminosity is a consequence of galaxy interactions we also discuss the implications of our results for the survivability of darkmatter cusps,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103350v1,Astronomy
we examine the formation and evolution of primordial black holes pbhs after hybrid inflation our goal is to assess the effects of various theoretical uncertainties on the extrapolation from a given inflation model to a spectrum of primordial black hole masses the context of our work is an examination of the possibility chen and adler 2003 macgibbon 1987 that the dark matter is comprised of planckmass black hole remnants bhrs as an example we focus on a particular scenario chen 2003 in which the black holes form from quantum perturbations that were generated during hybrid inflation we find the correspondence between hybrid inflation parameters and the range of initial pbh masses that would allow bhrs to comprise the dark matter taking account of the possible early presence of radiation and its accretion onto the pbhs,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504606v1,Astronomy
gravitational waves from the coalescence of binary black holes carry away linear momentum causing center of mass recoil this radiation rocket effect has important implications for systems with escape speeds of order the recoil velocity we revisit this problem using black hole perturbation theory treating the binary as a test mass spiraling into a spinning hole for extreme mass ratios q m1m2 1 we compute the recoil for the slow inspiral epoch of binary coalescence very accurately these results can be extrapolated to q 04 with modest accuracy although the recoil from the final plunge contributes significantly to the final recoil we are only able to make crude estimates of its magnitude we find that the recoil can easily reach 100200 kms but most likely does not exceed 500 kms though much lower than previous estimates this recoil is large enough to have important astrophysical consequences these include the ejection of black holes from globular clusters dwarf galaxies and highredshift dark matter halos,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402056v2,Astronomy
there is compelling evidence that supermassive black holes exist yet the origin of these objects or their seeds is still unknown we discuss several plausible scenarios for forming the seeds of supermassive black holes these include the catastrophic collapse of supermassive stars the collapse of relativistic clusters of collisionless particles or stars the gravothermal evolution of dense clusters of ordinary stars or stellarmass compact objects and the gravothermal evolution of selfinteracting dark matter halos einsteins equations of general relativity are required to describe key facets of these scenarios and largescale numerical simulations are performed to solve them,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304202v1,Astronomy
one of the most intriguing problem of modern physics is the question of the endpoint of black hole evaporation based on einsteindilatongaussbonnet four dimensional string gravity model we show that black holes do not disappear and that the end of the evaporation process leaves some relic the possibility of experimental detection of the remnant black holes is investigated if they really exist such objects could be a considerable part of the non baryonic dark matter in our universe,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0201069v5,Astronomy

velocitydependent interactions in a fundamentalstring dominated universe lead quite naturally with reasonable assumptions on initial conditions to an accelerating expanding universe without assuming the existence of a cosmological constant this result also holds generically for a universe dominated by moving extremal black holes owing to a repulsive velocity dependent force this interaction however does not preclude structure formation here we discuss a toy model including both ordinary and extremal matter in which the latter accounts for dark matter while simultaneously acting as effective dark energy eternal acceleration is once more seen to arise in this case,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303422v1,Astronomy
we study the distribution of fermionic dark matter at the center of galaxies using nfw moore and isothermal density profiles and show that dark matter becomes degenerate for particle masses of a few rm kev and for distances less than a few parsec from the center of our galaxy a compact degenerate core forms after galaxy merging and boosts the growth of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies to explain the galactic center black hole of mass of sim 35 times 106modot and a supermassive black hole of sim 3 times 109modot at a redshift of 641 in sdss quasars we require a degenerate core of mass between 3 times 103 modot and 35 times 106modot this constrains the mass of the dark matter particle between 06 rm kev and 82 rm kev the lower limit on the dark matter mass is improved to rm 7 kev if exact solutions of poissons equation are used in the isothermal power law case we argue that the constrained particle could be the long sought dark matter of the universe that is interpreted here as a sterile neutrino,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609388v1,Astronomy
we consider the consequences of sidm for a velocity dependent cross section per unit mass accretion of sidm onto seed black holes can produce supermassive black holes that are too large for certain combinations of parameterswhich is used to obtain a new constraint on the dark matter interaction constraints due to other considerations are presented and previous ones are generalized the black hole constraint is extremely sensitive to the slope alpha of the inner density profile of dark halos for the most probable value of alpha13 there exists a narrow range in parameter space such that all constraints are satisfied however the adiabatic compression of the dark halo by baryons as they cool and contract in normal galaxies yields a steeper cusp alpha17 this gives a tighter constraint which would exclude sidm as a possible solution to the purported problems with cdm in the absence of other dynamical processes nevertheless sidm with parameters consistent with this stronger constraint can explain the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies a best fit model is presented which reproduces the supermassive black hole masses and their observed correlations with the velocity dispersion of the host bulges specifically the fourth power dependence of black hole mass on velocity dispersion is a direct consequence of the power spectrum having an index of n2 although the dark matter collision rates for this model are too small to directly remedy problems with cdm mergers between dark halos harboring supermassive black holes at high redshift could ameliorate the cuspy halo problem this scenario also explains the lack of comparable supermassive black holes in bulgeless galaxies like m33,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108203v2,Astronomy

we investigate the evolution of high redshift seed black hole masses at late times and their observational signatures the massive black hole seeds studied here form at extremely high redshifts from the direct collapse of pregalactic gas discs populating dark matter halos with seeds formed in this way we follow the mass assembly of these black holes to the present time using a montecarlo merger tree using this machinery we predict the black hole mass function at high redshifts and at the present time the integrated mass density of black holes and the luminosity function of accreting black holes as a function of redshift these predictions are made for a set of three seed models with varying black hole formation efficiency given the accuracy of current observational constraints all 3 models can be adequately fit discrimination between the models appears predominantly at the low mass end of the present day black hole mass function which is not observationally well constrained however all our models predict that low surface brightness bulgeless galaxies with large discs are least likely to be sites for the formation of massive seed black holes at high redshifts the efficiency of seed formation at high redshifts has a direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction in galaxies at z0 this effect is more pronounced for low mass galaxies this is the key discriminant between the models studied here and the population iii remnant seed model we find that there exists a population of low mass galaxies that do not host nuclear black holes our prediction of the shape of the black hole mass velocity dispersion relation at the low mass end is in agreement with the recent observational determination from the census of low mass galaxies in the virgo cluster,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0529v2,Astronomy

recently there has been a growing evidence in favor of the presence of an intermediate mass black hole in the globular cluster g1 in andromeda galaxy in this paper we explore whether the adiabatic growth in the dark matter density due to the presence of a black hole could result in an observable gamma ray signal due to dark matter annihilation in this globular cluster starting from an initial nfw matter profile with density parameters consistent with g1 observations we find that indeed if the spike in the density has been formed and has survived till present the signal could be observed by glast and current act detectors,http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4181v2,Astronomy
abridged we present a model in which the seeds of supermassive black holes form from the lowest angular momentum gas in protogalaxies at high redshift we show that this leads to a correlation between black hole masses and spheroid properties as observed today we assume that gas in earlyforming rare halos has a distribution of specific angular momentum similar to that expected for dark matter halos this distribution has a significant low angular momentum tail which implies that every protogalaxy should contain gas that ends up in a highdensity disc in halos more massive than a critical threshold of 108msun the discs are gravitationally unstable and experience an efficient linpringle viscosity that allows mass inflow this process continues until the first massive stars disrupt the disc black holes are created with a characteristic mass of 105 msun independent of the redshift of formation this serves as a lower bound for blackhole masses in galaxies today the comoving mass density of black hole seeds grows with time and saturates when cosmic reionization stops gas cooling in these lowmass systems by z15 the comoving mass density becomes comparable to that inferred from observations with room for appropriate additional luminous growth during a later quasar accretion phase hierarchical merging after z15 naturally leads to a linear correlation between blackhole mass and stellar spheroid mass with negligible black hole masses in discdominated galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0311487v2,Astronomy
we describe a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can form directly in the nuclei of protogalaxies without the need for seed black holes left over from early star formation selfgravitating gas in dark matter halos can lose angular momentum rapidly via runaway global dynamical instabilities the socalled bars within bars mechanism this leads to the rapid buildup of a dense selfgravitating core supported by gas pressure surrounded by a radiation pressuredominated envelope which gradually contracts and is compressed further by subsequent infall these conditions lead to such high temperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically by thermal neutrino emission leading to the formation and rapid growth of a central black hole we estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typical conditions in metalfree halos with tvir 104 k which are the most likely to be susceptible to runaway infall the initial black hole should have a mass of 20 solar masses but in principle could grow at a supereddington rate until it reaches 104106 solar masses rapid growth may be limited by feedback from the accretion process andor disruption of the mass supply by star formation or halo mergers even if supereddington growth stops at 103104 solar masses this process would give black holes ample time to attain quasarsize masses by a redshift of 6 and could also provide the seeds for all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602363v2,Astronomy

we investigate the relation between circular velocity vc and bulge velocity dispersion sigma in spiral galaxies based on literature data and new spectroscopic observations we find a strong nearly linear vcsigma correlation with a negligible intrinsic scatter and a striking agreement with the corresponding relation for elliptical galaxies the least massive galaxies sigma 80 kms significantly deviate from this relation we combine this vcsigma correlation with the wellknown mbhsigma relation to obtain a tight correlation between circular velocity and supermassive black hole mass and interpret this as observational evidence for a close link between supermassive black holes and the dark matter haloes in which they presumably formed apart from being an important ingredient for theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution the relation between mbh and circular velocity has the potential to become an important practical tool in estimating supermassive black hole masses in spiral galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404465v1,Astronomy
while there exist various candidates the identification of dark matter remains unresolved recently it was argued that the generalized uncertainty principle gup may prevent a black hole from evaporating completely and as a result there should exist a plancksize bhr at the end of its evaporation we speculate that the stability of bhr may be further protected by supersymmetry in the form of extremal black hole if this is indeed the case and if a sufficient amount of small black holes can be produced in the early universe then the resultant bhrs can be an interesting candidate for dm we demonstrate that this is the case in the hybrid inflation model by assuming bhr as dm our notion imposes a constraint on the hybrid inflation potential we show that such a constraint is not finetuned possible observational signatures are briefly discussed,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406514v1,Astronomy
we show that the hierarchical assembly of cold dark matter cdm haloes preserves the memory of the initial conditions using nbody cosmological simulations we demonstrate that the presentday spatial distribution and kinematics of objects that formed within early z 10 protogalactic systems old stars satellite galaxies globular clusters massive black holes etc depends mostly on the rarity of the peak of the primordial density field which they originally belonged to only for objects forming at lower redshifts the exact formation site within the progenitor halo eg whether near the center or in an extended disk becomes important in presentday haloes material from the rarer early peaks is more centrally concentrated and falls off more steeply with radius compared to the overall mass distribution it has a lower velocity dispersion moves on more radial orbits and has a more elongated shape population ii stars that formed within protogalactic haloes collapsing from 25 sigma fluctuations would follow today a r35 density profile with a halflight radius of 17 kpc and a velocity anisotropy that increases from isotropic in the inner regions to nearly radial at the halo edge this agrees well with the radial velocity dispersion profile of galaxy halo stars from battaglia et al 2005 and with the anisotropic orbits of nearby halo stars,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506615v4,Astronomy
the annihilation of neutralino dark matter may result in observable signals in different wavelength in the present paper we will discuss the effect of neutralino annihilation in the halo of our galaxy and in its center according to high resolution cold dark matter simulations large virialized halos are formed through the constant merging of smaller halos appeared at previous times at each epoch dark matter halos have then a clumpy component which is made of these merging subhalos the annihilation of dark matter in these clumps always present in the halo of our galaxy may be responsible for appreciable fluxes of gammarays potentially detectable we find that depending on the fundamental parameters of the clump density profile and on the distribution of clumps in the galactic halo the contribution to the diffuse gammaray background from clumps could be used to obtain constraints on the neutralino properties such as mass and annihilation cross section on the other hand the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the galactic center may result in radio signals at the galactic center infact the accretion flow onto the central black hole sustains strong magnetic fields that can induce synchrotron emission in the radio wavelength by electrons and positrons generated in neutralino annihilations during advection onto the black hole we find that the observed emission from the galactic center is consistent with neutralinos following a navarro frenk and white density profile at the galactic center while it is inconsistent with the presence of a spike density profile supposed to be generated by the formation history of the central black hole,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405110v1,Astronomy
shortened weakly interacting massive particles are often said to be the best dark matter candidates studies have shown however that rather large dark matterphoton or dark matterbaryon interactions could be allowed by cosmology here we address the question of the role of the dark matter interactions in more detail to determine at which extent dark matter has to be necessarily weakly interacting to this purpose we compute the collisional damping and freestreaming lengths of generic interacting dark matter candidates and compare them to the scale of the smallest primordial structures known to exist in the universe we obtain necessary conditions that any candidate must satisfy we point out the existence of new dark matter scenarios and exhibit new damping regimes for example an interacting candidate may bear a similar damping than that of collisionless warm dark matter particles the main difference is due to the dark matter coupling to interacting or even freelypropagating species our approach yields a general classification of dark matter candidates which extends the definitions of the usual cold warm and hot dark matter scenarios when interactions weak or strong are considered,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0410591v1,Astronomy

dark matter annihilation in socalled spikes near black holes is believed to be an important method of indirect dark matter detection in the case of circular particle orbits the density profile of dark matter has a plateau at small radii the maximal density being limited by the annihilation crosssection however in the general case of arbitrary velocity anisotropy the situation is different particulary for isotropic velocity distribution the density profile cannot be shallower than r12 in the very centre indeed a detailed study reveals that in many cases the term annihilation plateau is misleading as the density actually continues to rise towards small radii and forms a weak cusp rho rbeta12 where beta is the anisotropy coefficient the annihilation flux however does not change much in the latter case if averaged over an area larger than the annihilation radius,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3334v2,Astronomy

the prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is often considered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in curved spacetime yet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions that ordinary physics may be applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy scales increasing exponentially without bound and that quantumgravitational effects may be neglected various suggestions have been put forward to address these issues that they might be explained away by lessons from sonic black hole models that the prediction is indeed successfully reproduced by quantum gravity that the success of the link provided by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies the prediction this paper explains the nature of the difficulties and reviews the proposals that have been put forward to deal with them none of the proposals put forward can so far be considered to be really successful and simple dimensional arguments show that quantumgravitational effects might well alter the evaporation process outlined by hawking thus a definitive theoretical treatment will require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some regimes until then no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation by black holes is likely to be made the possibility that nonradiating mini black holes exist should be taken seriously such holes could be part of the dark matter in the universe attempts to place observational limits on the number of mini black holes independent of the assumption that they radiate would be most welcome,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0304042v1,Astronomy
first results of a numerical investigation of primordial black hole formation in the radiation dominated phase of the early universe are presented the simulations follow the gravitational collapse of three different families of highamplitude density fluctuations imposed at the time of horizon crossing the threshold for black hole formation deltac approx 07 is found to be nearly identical for all perturbation families if the control parameter delta is chosen as the total excess mass within the initial horizon volume furthermore we demonstrate that the scaling of black hole mass with distance from the formation threshold known to occur in nearcritical gravitational collapse applies to primordial black hole formation,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9806043v1,Astronomy
the existence of quasars at redshift z 5 indicates that supermassive black holes were present since the very early times if they grew by accretion the seeds of mass 105 msun must have formed at z 9 these seed black holes may result from the collapse and dissipation of primordial gas during the early stages of galaxy formation i discuss the effects of magnetic fields on the fragmentation of cold gas clouds embedded into a hot diffuse phase and a virialized dark matter halo the field of 104 g ejected by supernova remnants can halt cloud breakup at 104 msun high star formation rates keep the clouds partially ionized making ambipolar diffusion inefficient the magneticallysupported clouds collapse into black holes which later spiral via dynamical friction into a central cluster with the total mass mbh 6 106 msun as the cluster collapses the black holes merge emitting gravitational radiation that should be detectable by lisa,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108070v1,Astronomy

we investigate the recently proposed hybrid inflation models with two stages of inflation we show that quantum fluctuations at the time corresponding to the phase transition between the two inflationary stages can trigger the formation of a large number of inflating topological defects in order to study density perturbations in these models we develop a new method to calculate density perturbations in a system of two scalar fields we show that density perturbations in hybrid inflation models of the new type can be very large on the scale corresponding to the phase transition the resulting density inhomogeneities lead to a copious production of black holes this could be an argument against hybrid inflation models with two stages of inflation however we find a class of models where this problem can be easily avoided the number of black holes produced in these models can be made extremely small but in general it could be sufficiently large to have important cosmological and astrophysical implications in particular for certain values of parameters these black holes may constitute the dark matter in the universe it is also possible to have hybrid models with two stages of inflation where the black hole production is not suppressed but where the typical masses of the black holes are very small such models lead to a completely different thermal history of the universe where postinflationary reheating occurs via black hole evaporation,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9605094v3,Astronomy
blue primordial power spectra have spectral index n1 and arise naturally in the recently proposed hybrid inflationary scenario an observational upper limit on em n is derived by normalizing the spectrum at the quadrupole scale and considering the possible overproduction of planck mass relics formed in the final stage of primordial black hole evaporation in the inflationary universe with the maximum reheating temperature compatible with the observed quadrupole anisotropy the upper limit is n14 but it is slightly weaker for lower reheat temperatures this limit applies over 57 decades of mass and is therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and any gravitational wave contribution to the quadrupole anisotropy it is also independent of the dark matter content of the universe and therefore the bias parameter in some circumstances there may be an extended dustlike phase between the end of inflation and reheating in this case primordial black holes form more abundantly and the upper limit is n13,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9405027v1,Astronomy
the origin of supermassive black holes in the galactic nuclei is quite uncertain in spite of extensive set of observational data we review the known scenarios of galactic and cosmological formation of supermassive black holes the common drawback of galactic scenarios is a lack of time and shortage of matter supply for building the supermassive black holes in all galaxies by means of accretion and merging the cosmological scenarios are only fragmentarily developed but propose and pretend to an universal formation mechanism for supermassive black holes,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0070v2,Astronomy
we explore the possibility that massive black holes comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter of our galaxy by studying the dissolution of galactic globular clusters bombarded by them in our simulations we evolve the clusters along a sequence of king models determined by changes of state resulting from collisions with the black holes the results divide naturally into regimes of small and large black hole mass small black holes do not destroy clusters in single collisions their effect is primarily cumulative leading to a relation between mbh and fhalo the fraction of the halo in black holes of mass mbh which is fhalombh constant up to logarithmic corrections for fhalo1 we find mbh simless 103 msun by requiring survival of the same clusters studied by moore 1993 who neglected cluster evolution mass loss and stochasticity of energy inputs in his estimates but reached a similar conclusion large black holes may not penetrate a cluster without disrupting it their effect is mainly catastrophic close collisions but also partly cumulative distant collisions in the large mbh limit fhalo but not mbh can be constrained by computing the probability that a cluster survives a combination of close destructive encounters and distant nondestructive encounters we find that it is unlikely that fhalo simgreat 03 by requiring 50 per cent survival probability for moores clusters over 1010 years,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811370v1,Astronomy
we investigate how central black holes bhs inhabited in galactic dark halos could affect strong gravitational lensing the distribution of integral lensing probability with image separations are calculated for quasars of redshift 15 by foreground dark matter halos the mass density of dark halos is taken to be the navarrofrenkwhite nfw profile such that when the mass of a halo is less than 1014 msun its central black holes or a bulge is included as a point mass the relationship between the masses mbullet of supermassive black holes and the total gravitational mass mmathrmdm of their host galaxy is adopted from the most recent literature only a flat lambdacdm model is considered here it is shown that while a single black hole for each galaxy contributes considerable but not sufficient lensing probabilities at small image separations compared with those without black holes the bulges which are about 1001000 times larger in mass than a typical black hole would definitely contribute enough probabilities at small image separations although it gives too high probabilities at large separation angles compared with lensing observations,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207268v2,Astronomy
black holes with masses mbh1085 msun dominate the accretion history of the universe these black hole masses are typical of those found in radioselected galaxies today suggesting that the giant elliptical hosts of low redshift radio galaxies were the hosts of powerful mostly radioquiet quasars in the high redshift universe the reason that all radio galaxies are found in such hosts may be the correlation of black hole mass with radio luminosity but it is emphasized that accretion rate too plays an important role in the production of powerful radio jets the tight kz relation of luminous high redshift radio galaxies is probably a selection effect due to the selection on high black hole masses and high accretion rates luminous radio galaxies are the radioloud part of the quasar2 population and the ratio of radioloud quasars to luminous radio galaxies about 11 is so far our only good estimate of the relative numbers of quasar1s and quasar2s the numbers of radioquiet and radiointermediate quasar2s are still uncertain but a much larger population than the quasar1s would conflict with constraints from the presentday black hole mass density a comparison of the number densities of dark matter haloes and the high redshift quasars however suggests that there are plenty of dark haloes capable of hosting the known high redshift agn and thus room for a significant but not huge quasar2 population,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303348v1,Astronomy
recent observations of nearinfrared and xray flares from sagittarius a which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the galactic center show that the source exhibits about 20minute periodic variability here we provide arguments based on a quantitative analysis that supermassive objects at galactic centers may be bubbles of dark matter axions rather than black holes an oscillating axion bubble can explain periodic variability of sagittarius a and yields the axion mass about 06 mev which fits in the open axion mass window the bubble scenario with no other free parameters explains lack of supermassive black holes with mass m106 msun lowmass bubbles decay fast and as a result are very rare we also found that the mass of an axion bubble can not exceed 15times 109 msun in agreement with the upper limit on the supermassive black hole mass obtained from observations our finding if confirmed suggests that einstein general relativity is invalid for strong gravity and the gravitational field for the bubble effectively becomes repulsive at large potential imaging a shadow of the black hole at the galactic center with vlbi in the next decade can distinguish between the black hole and the oscillating axion bubble scenarios in the case of axion bubble a steady shadow will not be observed instead the shadow will appear and disappear periodically with a period of about 20 min,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607179v2,Astronomy

if supermassive black holes smbhs are the energy sources that power quasars and active galactic nuclei then qso sdss 11485251 the quasar with the highest redshift zqso643 hosts a supermassive black hole formed within 09 gyr after the big bang this requirement places constraints on the cosmological formation of smbhs believed to grow from smaller initial seeds by a combination of accretion and mergers we focus on gas accretion onto seeds produced by the collapse of pop iii stars at high redshift we incorporate the results of recent relativistic mhd simulations of disk accretion onto kerr black holes to track the coupled evolution of the masses and spins of the holes we allow for an additional amplification of 104 in the mass of a typical seed due to mergers consistent with recent monte carlo simulations of hierarchical mergers of cold dark matter halos containing black hole seeds we find that the growth of pop iii black hole seeds to 109 msun by zqso 643 favors mhd accretion disks over standard thin disks mhd disks tend to drive the holes to a submaximal equilibrium spin rate am 095 and radiation efficiency epsilonm 02 while standard thin disks drive them to maximal spin am 1 and efficiency epsilonm 042 this small difference in efficiency results in a huge difference in mass amplification by accretion at the eddington limit the mhd equilibrium efficiency is consistent with the observed ratio of the qso plus agn luminosity density to the local smbh mass density our prototype analysis is designed to stimulate the incorporation of results from relativistic stellar collapse and mhd accretion simulations in future monte carlo simulations of hierarchical structure formation to better determine the cosmological role of smbhs and their mass and spin distributions,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411156v1,Astronomy
we investigate the possibility that presentday galaxies and their dark matter haloes contain a population of massive black holes mbhs that form by hierarchical merging of the black hole remnants of the first stars in the universe some of the mbhs may be large enough or close enough to the centre of the galactic host that they merge within a hubble time we estimate to what extent this process could contribute to the mass of the supermassive black holes smbhs observed in galactic centres today the relation between smbh and galactic bulge mass in our model displays the same slope as that found in observations many mbhs will not reach the centre of the host halo however but continue to orbit within it in doing so mbhs may remain associated with remnants of the satellite halo systems of which they were previously a part using a semianalytical approach that explicitly accounts for dynamical friction tidal disruption and encounters with galactic disks we follow the hierarchical merging of mbh systems and their subsequent dynamical evolution inside the respective host haloes we predict the mass and abundance of mbhs in presentday galactic haloes and also estimate the mbh mass accretion rates as well as bolometric luminosities for two different accretion scenarios mbhs that have not undergone recent merging will retain associated dark matter cusps that were enhanced by black hole accretion growth and may be possible sources of gamma rays via neutralino annihilations,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307171v1,Astronomy
we determine the total enclosed mass profile from 07 to 35 kpc in the elliptical galaxy ngc 4636 based on the hot interstellar medium temperature profile measured using the chandra xray observatory and other xray and optical data the total mass increases as radius to the power 12 to a good approximation over this range in radii attaining a total of 15 trillion solar masses corresponding to a masstolight ratio of 40 solar masses per solar visual luminosity at 35 kpc we find that at least half and as much as 80 of the mass within the optical halflight radius is nonluminous implying that ngc 4636 has an exceptionally low baryon fraction the large inferred dark matter concentration and central dark matter density consistent with the upper end of the range expected for standard cold dark matter halos imply that mechanisms proposed to explain low dark matter densities in less massive galaxies eg selfinteracting dark matter warm dark matter explosive feedback are not effective in elliptical galaxies and presumably by extension in galaxy clusters the composite black hole stars and dark matter mass distribution has a generally steep slope with no core consistent with gravitational lensing studies,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0208090v1,Astronomy
the babichevdokuchaeveroshenko model for the accretion of dark energy onto black holes has been extended to deal with black holes with nonstatic metrics the possibility that for an asymptotic observer a black hole with large mass will rapidly increase and eventually engulf the universe at a finite time in the future has been studied by using reasonable values for astronomical parameters it is concluded that such a phenomenon is forbidden for all black holes in quintessential cosmological models,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603761v1,Astronomy
in light of recent evidence suggesting a nonzero presentday cosmological constant adams mbonye laughlin 1999 have considered the evolution of black holes in the presence of vacuum energy using the assumption that lambda remains constant with time and a conjecture based on a paper by mallett 1986 they reach the remarkable conclusion that black holes with current mass greater than about 2109 msun will not hawking evaporate in the distant future but will instead absorb vacuum energy and grow to roughly the de sitter horizon size in this letter we reexamine black hole evaporation in the presence of vacuum energy and find instead that all known black holes will eventually evaporate,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0008260v1,Astronomy

many lines of evidence suggest that nonbaryonic dark matter constitutes roughly 30 of the critical closure density but the composition of this dark matter is unknown one class of candidates for the dark matter is compact objects formed in the early universe with typical masses m between 01 and 1 solar masses to correspond to the mass scale of objects found with microlensing observing projects specific candidates of this type include black holes formed at the epoch of the qcd phase transition quark stars and boson stars here we show that accretion onto these objects produces substantial ionization in the early universe with an optical depth to thomson scattering out to z1100 of approximately tau24 fcoepsilon1mmsun12 h0651 where epsilon1 is the accretion efficiency epsilonequiv ldot mc2 divided by 01 and fco is the fraction of matter in the compact objects the current upper limit to the scattering optical depth based on the anisotropy of the microwave background is approximately 04 therefore if accretion onto these objects is relatively efficient they cannot be the main component of nonbaryonic dark matter,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003176v1,Astronomy

the idea that dark matter in the form of small compact bodies most plausibly planetary mass primordial black holes betrays its presence by the microlensing of quasars has been stimulated by statistical studies of quasar light curves and gravitationally lensed quasar systems in this paper we review this evidence and discuss the significance of the recent detection of a planetary mass microlensing event in the galaxy by the macho group we also look in more detail at the light curves themselves and make the case that many show the characteristic morphology of caustic crossing events associated with a large optical depth of lenses this supports the idea that a large fraction of the critical density is in the form of planetary mass compact bodies the nature of such bodies is discussed and it is argued that current work on the qcd phase transition suggests they are primordial black holes although it is just possible that they are compact gas clouds,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811019v1,Astronomy

we demonstrate that the luminosity function of the recently detected population of starforming galaxies and the qso luminosity function at z3 can be matched with the mass function of dark matter haloes predicted by hierarchical cosmogonies for lifetimes of optically bright qsos in the range 106 to 108 yr we suggest that the mass of supermassive black holes may be limited by the backreaction of the emitted energy on the accretion flow in a selfgravitating disc this would imply a relation of black hole to halo mass of the form mbh vhalo5 and a typical duration of the optically bright qso phase of a few times 107 yr the high integrated mass density of black holes inferred from recent black hole mass estimates in nearby galaxies may indicate that the overall efficiency of supermassive black holes for producing blue light is smaller than previously assumed we discuss three possible accretion modes with low optical emission efficiency i accretion at far above the eddington rate ii accretion obscured by dust and iii accretion below the critical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for a hubble time we further argue that accretion with low optical efficiency might be closely related to the origin of the hard xray background and that the ionizing background might be progressively dominated by stars rather than qsos at higher redshift,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9712259v1,Astronomy

gravitational lensing is a well known phenomenon predicted by the general theory of relativity it is now a welldeveloped observational technique in astronomy and is considered to be a fundamental tool for acquiring information about the nature and distribution of dark matter in particular gravitational lensing experiments may be used to search for black holes it has been proposed that a schwarzschild black hole may act as a retrolens holz wheeler citehw which if illuminated by a powerful light source eg the sun deflects light ray paths to large bending angles so that the light may reach the observer here by considering the strong field limit in the deflection angle and confining our analysis to the black hole equatorial plane we extend the holzwheeler results to slowly spinning kerr black holes by considering the holzwheeler geometrical configuration for the lens source and observer we find that the inclusion of rotation does not substantially change the brightness of the retrolensing images with respect to the schwarzschild case we also discuss the possibility that the next generation spacebased telescopes may detect such retroimages and eventually put limits on the rotational parameter of the black hole,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401384v1,Astronomy
large dynamic range numerical simulations of atomic cooling driven collapse of gas in pregalactic dm haloes with tvir 10000 k show that the gas loses 90 and more of its angular momentum before rotational support sets in in a fraction of these haloes where the metallicity is low and uv radiation suppresses h2 cooling conditions are thus very favourable for the rapid buildup of massive black holes depending on the progression of metal enrichment the continued suppression of h2 cooling by external and internal uv radiation and the ability to trap the entropy produced by the release of gravitational energy the gas at the centre of the halo is expected to form a supermassive star a stellarmass black hole accreting at supereddington accretion rates or a compact starcluster undergoing collisional runaway of massive stars at its centre in all three cases a massive black hole of initially modest mass finds itself at the center of a rapid inflow of gas with inflow rates of 1 msolaryr the massive black hole will thus grow quickly to a mass of 105 to 106 msolar until further inflow is halted either by consumption of gas by star formation or by the increasing energy and momentum feedback from the growing massive black hole conditions for the formation of massive seed black holes in this way are most favourable in haloes with tvir 15000 k and vvir 20 kms with less massive haloes not allowing collapse of gas by atomic cooling and more massive haloes being more prone to fragmentation this should imprint a characteristic mass on the mass spectrum of an early population of massive black hole seeds in pregalactic haloes which will later grow into the observed population of supermassive black holes in galactic bulges,http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2802v1,Astronomy

hawking has shown that if black holes were to exist in a universe that expands forever black holes would completely evaporate violating unitarity i argue this means unitarity requires that the universe exist for only a finite future proper time i develop this argument showing that unitarity also requires the boundaries of all future sets to be cauchy surfaces and so no event horizons can exist thus the null generators of the surfaces of astrophysical black holes must leave the surface in both time directions allowing nonspherical topologies for black hole surfaces since all information eventually escapes astrophysical black holes and since the null surfaces defining astrophysical black holes are cauchy surfaces holography automatically holds i further show that unitarity requires the effective cosmological constant to be zero eventually since otherwise the universe would expand forever,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104011v1,Astronomy

vacuum polarization in a strong field such as hawking radiation from black holes is constrained by the directional metric of strong field vectors relative localization of the quanta and the schwarzschild radius is examined concept of thermal equilibrium of excited vacuum is critically analyzed and judged as disequilibrium because virtual modes or particles are mutually independent the result shows that primordial microsize black holes pmbhs cannot produce much hawking radiation via fermions bosons or thermal photons primordial black holes produced in the early epoch of the big bang should be very stable over hubble time and consequently may constitute a significant part of the cold dark matter in the structural formation of the universe pmbhs should be gravitationally highlycondensed as missing mass around galaxies and galaxy clusters and remain very difficult to observe,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407440v1,Astronomy
the relationships between supermassive black holes and the properties of their associated darkmatter halos imply that outflows from accreting black holes provide a feedback mechanism regulating galaxy formation accreting black holes with weak or undetectable radio jets radioquiet quasars outnumber those with powerful jets radioloud quasars by a factor 10100 so powerfuljet outflows are often neglected however whenever powerful jets are triggered there is a dramatic factor 100 stepfunction increase in the efficiency of feedback we use a feedback model together with the measured space density of flatspectrum radioloud quasars to show that a powerfuljet episode probably occurred in every protocluster in the universe before jet triggering there was time for gravitational collapse to create many 10100 surrounding protogalaxies massive enough to host radioquiet quasars after triggering the powerful jet pushes back and heats ionized gas so that it cannot fall onto these protogalaxies and cool once neutralmolecular gas reservoirs become exhausted there is a synchronized shut down in both starformation and blackhole activity throughout the protocluster these considerations imply that radioloud quasars have a profound influence on the evolution of all the galaxies seen in clusters today,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409687v1,Astronomy

we analyzed a sample of high and low surface brightness hsb and lsb disc galaxies and elliptical galaxies to investigate the correlation between the circular velocity vc and the central velocity dispersion sigma we better defined the previous vcsigma correlation for hsb and elliptical galaxies especially at the lower end of the sigma values elliptical galaxies with vc based on dynamical models or directly derived from the hi rotation curves follow the same relation as the hsb galaxies in the vsigma plane on the contrary the lsb galaxies follow a different relation since most of them show either higher vc or lower sigma with respect to the hsb galaxies this argues against the relevance of baryon collapse in the radial density profile of the dark matter haloes of lsb galaxies moreover if the vcsigma relation is equivalent to one between the mass of the dark matter halo and that of the supermassive black hole these results suggest that the lsb galaxies host a supermassive black hole with a smaller mass compared to hsb galaxies of equal dark matter halo on the other hand if the fundamental correlation of smbh mass is with the halo vc then lsbs should have larger black hole masses for given bulge sigma,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512640v1,Astronomy
this work considers the idea of massive black holes being the constituents of the galactic dark matter halo it constrains the maximum black hole mass to mbh sil 5 times 104 msun by examining their influence on the population of globular clusters in our milky way in the adopted halo model globular clusters are exposed to constant bombardment of halo objects on their orbits through the galaxy and thus will steadily gain internal energy depending on the mass of these halo objects and the structural parameters of the globular clusters they can be disrupted on time scales of a few billion years and below these disruption time scales are calculated using a modification of the well known classical impulsive approximation and compared with direct nbody simulations of such encounter events to ensure the method works correctly for a set of ten prototypical globular cluster models and black hole masses ranging from 103 to 107msun montecarlosimulations of 10000 encounter histories over the period of 10 billion years were calculated each at three different galactocentric distances mboxr 5 10 and 15 kpc these data were compared with the real globular cluster population in our galaxy and used to obtain the above constraint of mbh sil 5 times 104 msun,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9511032v1,Astronomy
we have obtained deep multiband imaging observations around three of the most distant known quasars at redshifts z6 standard accretion theory predicts that the supermassive black holes present in these quasars were formed at a very early epoch if a correlation between black hole mass and dark matter halo mass is present at these early times then these rare supermassive black holes will be located inside the most massive dark matter halos these are therefore ideal locations to search for the first clusters of galaxies we use the lymanbreak technique to identify starforming galaxies at high redshifts our observations show no overdensity of starforming galaxies in the fields of these quasars the lack of dustfree luminous starburst companions indicates that the quasars may be the only massive galaxies in their vicinity undergoing a period of intense activity,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0410306v1,Astronomy

we use threedimensional highresolution adaptivemeshrefinement simulations to investigate if mechanical feedback from active galactic nucleus jets can halt a massive cooling flow in a galaxy cluster and give rise to a selfregulated accretion cycle we start with a 3 x 109msun black hole at the centre of a spherical halo with the mass of the virgo cluster initially all the baryons are in a hot intracluster medium in hydrostatic equilibrium within the dark matters gravitational potential the black hole accretes the surrounding gas at the bondi rate and a fraction of the accretion power is returned into the intracluster medium mechanically through the production of jets the accretion initially slow 00002msunyr becomes catastrophic as the gas cools and condenses in the dark matters potential therefore it cannot prevent the cooling catastrophe at the centre of the cluster however after this rapid phase where the accretion rate reaches a peak of 02msunyr the cavities inflated by the jets become highly turbulent the turbulent mixing of the shockheated gas with the rest of the intracluster medium puts a quick end to this shortlived rapidgrowth phase after dropping by almost two orders of magnitudes the black hole accretion rate stabilises at 0006msunyr without significant variations for several billions of years indicating that a selfregulated steadystate has been reached this accretion rate corresponds to a negligible increase of the black hole mass over the age of the universe but is sufficient to create a quasiequilibrium state in the cluster core,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611914v2,Astronomy
we present a simple scenario where the formation of galactic bulges was regulated by the dark halo gravity and regulated the growth of the central supermassive black hole assuming the angular momentum is low we suggest that bulges form in a runaway collapse due to the gravothermal instability once the central gas density or pressure exceeds certain threshold xu zhao 2007 we emphasize that the threshold is nearly universal set by the background nfw dark matter gravity gdm sim 12 times 108rm cm rm sec2 in the central cusps of halos unlike known thresholds for gradual formation of galaxy disks we show that the universal haloregulated star formation threshold for spheroids matches the very high star formation rate and star formation efficiency shown in highredshift observations of central starburst regions the starburst feedback also builds up a pressure shortly after the collapse this large pressure could both act outward to halt further infall of gas from larger scale and act inward to counter the comptonthick wind launched from the central black hole in an eddington accretion assuming the feedback balancing inward and outward forces our scenario naturally gives rise to the black holebulge relationships observed in the local universe,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701792v1,Astronomy

virial blackhole mass estimates are presented for 12698 quasars in the redshift interval 01z21 based on modelling of spectra from the sloan digital sky survey sdss first data release the blackhole masses of the sdss quasars are found to lie between simeq107msun and an upper limit of simeq 3times 109msun entirely consistent with the largest blackhole masses found to date in the local universe the estimated eddington ratios of the broadline quasars fwhm geq2000 km s1 show a clear upper boundary at lbolledd1 suggesting that the eddington luminosity is still a relevant physical limit to the accretion rate of luminous broadline quasars at zleq 2 by combining the blackhole mass distribution of the sdss quasars with the 2df quasar luminosity function the number density of active black holes at zsimeq 2 is estimated as a function of mass by comparing the estimated number density of active black holes at zsimeq 2 with the local mass density of dormant black holes we set lower limits on the quasar lifetimes and find that the majority of black holes with mass geq 1085msun are in place by simeq 2,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405393v1,Astronomy
the tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroids in nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these two components optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black holes in the universe and can account for 30 of the total cosmological blackhole growth as typical quasars are not however undergoing intense star formation and already host massive black holes 108 msun there must have been an earlier prequasar phase when these black holes grew mass range 106108 msun the likely signature of this earlier stage is simultaneous blackhole growth and star formation in distant ie z1 8 billion light years away luminous galaxies here we report ultradeep xray observations of distant starforming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre wavelengths we find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost continuously throughout periods of intense star formation this activity appears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval galaxy populations we show that the blackhole growth from these galaxies is consistent with that expected for the prequasar phase,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503453v1,Astronomy
the first stars in the universe forming at redshifts z15 in minihalos with masses of order 106 msun may leave behind black holes as their remnants these objects could conceivably serve as seeds for much larger black holes observed at redshifts z6 we study the growth of the remnant black holes through accretion including for the first time the emitted accretion radiation with adaptive mesh refinement cosmological radiationhydrodynamical simulations the effects of photoionization and heating dramatically affect the accretion flow from large scales resulting in negligible mass growth of the black hole we compare cases with the accretion luminosity included and neglected to show that the accretion radiation drastically changes the environment within 100 pc of the black hole where gas temperatures are increased by an order of magnitude the gas densities are reduced and further star formation in the same minihalo prevented for the two hundred million years of evolution we followed these calculations show that even without the radiative feedback included most seed black holes do not gain mass as efficiently as has been hoped for in previous theories implying that black hole remnants of pop iii stars that formed in minihalos are not likely to be the origin of miniquasars most importantly however these calculations demonstrate that if early stellar mass black holes are indeed accreting close to the bondihoyle rate with ten percent efficiency they have a dramatic local effect in regulating star formation in the first galaxies,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0820v2,Astronomy
the tight correlation between the masses of central black holes and their host spheroids in nearby galaxies and active galactic nuclei suggests that black hole growth is closely related to their spheroid formation based on our previous work regarding such a joint evolutionary scheme and the consequential black hole to bulge mass correlation we use the xray luminosity function of agn and the cosmological evolution rate which are from rosat xray surveys to estimate the cosmic star formation history associated with the black hole growth by the basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs during the luminous agn phase the luminosity function of agns as a function of redshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also the cosmic star formation history of the spheroids although the space density of the especially luminous qsos is very low we show that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive black hole growth is almost the same as that of lyman break galaxies detected by the current optical deep surveys we thus argue that the optical deep surveys may miss about half of the net star formation in our universe this is probably due to in part significant dust extinction as well as the small field of view of previous optical surveys which cannot sample such rare events with relatively short time scale however the far infrared emission from the dust heated by star fomation ongoing during the black hole growth could sufficiently account for the observed scuba number counts and would be the probable dominating energy source of the suba population,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212534v1,Astronomy
the ubiquity of supermassive black holes smbhs at the centers of nearby luminous galaxies can arise from the multiple mergers experienced by dark matter halos in hierarchical structure formation models even if only a small fraction of these galaxies harbor smbhs at high redshifts we illustrate this possibility using cosmological monte carlo simulations of the merger history of dark matter halos and their associated smbhs in our most extreme models in order to populate nearly every bright galaxy with a smbh at z0 only a few percent of the halos with virial temperatures above 104 k are required to harbor a smbh at high redshift this possibility must be included in studies of the luminosity function and the clustering properties of quasars we predict the number of smbh merger events that are detectable by the gravitational wave experiment lisa as a function of redshift out to z5 although the event rates can be significantly reduced in scenarios with rare smbhs a minimum of 10 detectable merger events per year is predicted if smbh binaries coalesce efficiently the observed distribution of events with redshift could yield valuable information on the smbh formation process if smbh binaries do not coalesce we find that at least several smbh slingshot ejections probably occurred from z5 to the present in each galaxy more massive than 1011 msun at z0 although our results are sensitive to the minimum cooling mass assumed for the formation of smbhs we expect the qualitative predictions of our models to be robust,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0101196v2,Astronomy

abridged using the number and sizes of observed gravitational lenses i derive upper limits on the dark matter content of elliptical galaxies galaxies built from cold dark matter cdm mass distributions are too concentrated to comfortably satisfy these limits scdm is ruled out and lcdm is only marginally consistent with the data thus lensing adds to the evidence that cdm mass distributions are too concentrated on kiloparsec scales to agree with real galaxies and extends the argument to elliptical galaxies by contrast the lack of central images in radio lenses implies that the central densities of cdm galaxies are too low on 10 parsec scales even if supermassive black holes are included selfinteracting dark matter or any other modification to regular cold dark matter must simultaneously reduce the densities on kiloparsec scales and increase the densities on parsec scales in order to satisfy the unique constraints from lensing,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105200v2,Astronomy

the observed number counts of quasars may be explained either by longlived activity within rare massive hosts or by shortlived activity within smaller more common hosts it has been argued that quasar lifetimes may therefore be inferred from their clustering length which determines the typical mass of the quasar host here we point out that the relationship between the mass of the blackhole and the circular velocity of its host darkmatter halo is more fundamental to the determination of the clustering length in particular the clustering length observed in the 2df quasar redshift survey is consistent with the galactic halo blackhole relation observed in local galaxies provided that quasars shine at 10100 of their eddington luminosity the slow evolution of the clustering length with redshift inferred in the 2df quasar survey favors a blackhole mass whose redshiftindependent scaling is with halo circular velocity rather than halo mass these results are independent from observations of the number counts of bright quasars which may be used to determine the quasar lifetime and its dependence on redshift we show that if quasar activity results from galaxy mergers then the number counts of quasars imply an episodic quasar lifetime that is set by the dynamical time of the host galaxy rather than by the salpeter time our results imply that as the redshift increases the central blackholes comprise a larger fraction of their host galaxy mass and the quasar lifetime gets shorter,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403714v1,Astronomy
after being destroyed by a binary supermassive black hole a stellar density cusp can regrow at the center of a galaxy via energy exchange between stars moving in the gravitational field of the single coalesced hole we illustrate this process via highaccuracy nbody simulations regeneration requires roughly one relaxation time and the new cusp extends to a distance of roughly onefifth the black holes influence radius with density rho r74 the mass in the cusp is of order 10 the mass of the black hole growth of the cusp is preceded by a stage in which the stellar velocity dispersion evolves toward isotropy and away from the tangentiallyanisotropic state induced by the binary we show that density profiles similar to those observed at the center of the milky way and m32 can regenerate themselves in several gyr following infall of a second black hole the presence of density cusps at the centers of these galaxies can therefore not be used to infer that no merger has occurred we argue that bahcallwolf cusps are ubiquitous in stellar spheroids fainter than mv 185 that contain supermassive black holes but the cusps have not been detected outside of the local group since their angular sizes are less than 01 we show that the presence of a cusp implies a lower limit of 104 per year on the rate of stellar tidal disruptions and discuss the consequences of the cusps for gravitational lensing and the distribution of dark matter on subparsec scales,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510498v4,Astronomy

quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes but the problem of the duty cycle related to the episodic activity of the black holes remains open as one of the major questions of cosmological evolution of quasars in this letter we obtain quasar duty cycles based on analyses of a large sample composed of 10979 quasars with redshifts zle21 from the sloan digital sky survey sdss data release three we estimate masses of quasar black holes and obtain their mass function mf of the present sample we then get the duty cycle bardeltaz103sim 1 based on the soltans argument implying that black holes are undergoing multiple episodic activity we find that the duty cycle has a strong evolution by comparison we show that evolution of the duty cycle follows the history of cosmic star formation rate sfr density in the universe providing intriguing evidence for a natural connection between star formation and triggering of black hole activity feedback on star formation from black hole activity is briefly discussed,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606704v1,Astronomy
we estimate the energy release of black hole formation to the intracluster medium of the coma cluster and find that this is comparable to the present day energy content therefore an energetic and maybe hydrostatic influence is possible our calculations rely on the assumption of an universal black hole to galaxy mass ratio more exactly spheroidal mass component of the stellar population for which there is growing evidence on a cosmological scale there is also an energy release of black hole formation comparable to what is expected to be present within the thermal gas caused by the process of structure formation this indicates an important dynamical influence neglected by present day structure formation simulations this estimate of cosmological black hole energy release is independent of the black hole to galaxy mass ratio but consistent with its value,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9803105v1,Astronomy

braneworld gravity is a model that endows physical space with an extra dimension in the type ii randallsundrum braneworld gravity model the extra dimension modifies the spacetime geometry around black holes and changes predictions for the formation and survival of primordial black holes we develop a comprehensive analytical formalism for farfield black hole lensing in this model using invariant quantities to compute all geometric optics lensing observables we then make the first analysis of wave optics in braneworld lensing working in the semiclassical limit we show that wave optics offers the only realistic way to observe braneworld effects in black hole lensing we point out that if primordial braneworld black holes exist have mass m and contribute a fraction f of the dark matter then roughly 3e5 x f m1e18 msun1 of them lie within our solar system these objects which we call attolenses would produce interference fringes in the energy spectra of gammaray bursts at energies 100 m1e18 msun1 mev which will soon be accessible with the glast satellite primordial braneworld black holes spread throughout the universe could produce similar interference effects the probability for attolensing may be nonnegligible if interference fringes were observed the fringe spacing would yield a simple upper limit on m detection of a primordial black hole with m 1e19 msun would challenge general relativity and favor the braneworld model further work on lensing tests of braneworld gravity must proceed into the physical optics regime which awaits a description of the full spacetime geometry around braneworld black holes,http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0603061v3,Astronomy
depending on various assumptions on the energy scale of inflation and assuming a primordial power spectrum of a broken scale invariance bsi type we explore the possibility for primordial black holes pbh and planck relics to contribute substantially to cold dark matter in the universe a recently proposed possibility to produce planck relics in 4dimensional string gravity is considered possible experimental detection through gravitational waves is further explored we stress that inflation with a low energy scale and also possibly when planck relics are produced leads unavoidably to relics originating from pbhs that are not effectively classical during their formation rendering the usual formalism inadequate for them,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303330v2,Astronomy
cosmic ray antiprotons can originate from dark matter annihilating into quarks that subsequently decay into antiprotons evaporation of primordial black holes also can produce a significant antiproton flux since the spectrum of secondary antiprotons from cosmic ray interactions peaks at 2 gev and goes down sharply at lower energy there is a window at energies 1 gev in which to look for excess antiprotons as a signature of these exotic antiproton sources however in the vicinity of the earth low energy particles are strongly modulated by the solar wind which makes any analysis ambiguous the adverse effects of the solar wind can be avoided by placing a low energy antiproton spectrometer aboard an interstellar probe the theoretical predictions are reviewed and the preliminary design of a lightweight lowpower instrument to make the measurements and a summary of the anticipated results are given in this paper,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9912140v1,Astronomy
the discovery of dark matter particles would conclusively reject the mond theory mond may violate einsteins strong equivalence principle however as we show there is already evidence that mond is likely not required mond was invented to explain the rotation velocities of stars far into the galactic halos dark matter also explains this same effect these both use a gravity probe of the ir2 law we show that non gravity probes determine the same value for the amount of dark matter that does not involve modifications of gravity using occams razor this coincidence is best explained by the existence of dark matter,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510576v1,Astronomy
caustics are a generic feature of the nonlinear growth of structure in the dark matter distribution if the dark matter were absolutely cold its mass density would diverge at caustics and the integrated annihilation probability would also diverge for individual particles participating in them for realistic dark matter candidates this behaviour is regularised by small but nonzero initial thermal velocities we present a mathematical treatment of evolution from hot warm or cold dark matter initial conditions which can be directly implemented in cosmological nbody codes it allows the identification of caustics and the estimation of their annihilation radiation in fully general simulations of structure formation,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0497v2,Astronomy
gravitational tunneling radiation gtr from a black hole is similar to electric field emission of electrons from a metal there is always a second body to give the gravitational barrier of a black hole a finite rather than infinite width so that a particle can escape by tunneling thus gtr may be emitted from black holes in a process differing from that of hawking radiation hr with broad ranging astrophysical ramifications hr of an isolated black hole is an abstraction which has not been detected in three decades and which may not exist gtr is beamed in contrast to hr which is isotropic little black holes may account for much of the dark matter of the universe and hence the anomalous rotation of spiral galaxies as well as contribute to the accelerated expansion of the universe the absence of hr permits the existence of little black hole gravitationally bound atoms with quantized orbits and quantized gravitational radiation since some theories speculate that the early universe may have existed in ndimensional space certain results will be presented both for general nspace and for the 3space in which we live an inconsistency between quantum mechanics and the equivalence principle is demonstrated it is shown that angular momentum cannot be quantized in the usual manner in 4space with possible consequences for kaluzaklein theory an hypothesis is presented for reducing the enormously toolarge vacuum zeropoint energy string theory may be impacted by the finding that atoms are not energetically stable in higher than 3space gtr avoids the black hole lost information paradox,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302469v4,Astronomy
we discuss the link between dark matter halos hosting the first popiii stars and the rare massive halos that are generally considered to host bright quasars at high redshift z6 the main question that we intend to answer is whether the supermassive black holes powering these qsos grew out from the seeds planted by the first intermediate massive black holes created in the universe this question involves a dynamical range of 1013 in mass and we address it by combining nbody simulations of structure formation to identify the most massive halos at z6 with a monte carlo method based on linear theory to obtain the location and formation times of the first light halos within the whole simulation box we show that the descendants of the first 106 msun virialized halos do not on average end up in the most massive halos at z6 but rather live in a large variety of environments the oldest popiii progenitors of the most massive halos at z6 form instead from density peaks that are on average one and a half standard deviations more common than the first popiii star formed in the volume occupied by one bright highz qso the intermediate mass black hole seeds planted by the very first popiii stars at z40 can easily grow to masses mbh1095 msun by z6 assuming eddington accretion with radiative efficiency epsilon01 quenching of the black hole accretion is therefore crucial to avoid an overabundance of supermassive black holes at lower redshift this can be obtained if the mass accretion is limited to a fraction eta6103 of the total baryon mass of the halo hosting the black hole the resulting high end slope of the black hole mass function at z6 is alpha 37 a value within the 1sigma error bar for the bright end slope of the observed quasar luminosity function at z6,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3843v1,Astronomy

the rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies are analysed the observations show that dark matter halos represent a oneparameter family with self similar density profiles the global halo parameters like total mass and scale length are coupled by simple scaling relations the inner halo regions resemble nonsingular isothermal spheres with constant density cores the observations are compared with dark matter halos resulting from cosmological cold dark matter simulations the theoretical models predict that dark matter halos represent a oneparameter family in agreement with the observations however in contradiction to the observations the calculations lead to dark matter halos with r1 density cusps in the center and nonisothermal velocity dispersion profiles processes which might affect the inner halo structure resulting in isothermal constant density cores are discussed,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9703057v1,Astronomy
we discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of structure formation to selfconsistently follow the build up of the cosmic population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei our model assumes that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos we then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the course of cosmic time for black holes that are active we distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback depending on the black hole accretion rate itself black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be in a quasar regime where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas for black holes with low accretion rates we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in mechanical form where agndriven bubbles are injected into a gaseous environment using our new model we carry out treesph cosmological simulations on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters both for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes we demonstrate that our model produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement with observational constraints we find that the black holes significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies changing their star formation history their amount of cold gas and their colours also the properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles and to a suppression of strong cooling flows abridged,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2238v2,Astronomy
a longstanding question is whether active galactic nuclei agn vary like galactic black hole systems when appropriately scaled up by mass refs 13 if so we can then determine how agn should behave on cosmological timescales by studying the brighter and much faster varying galactic systems as xray emission is produced very close to the black holes it provides one of the best diagnostics of their behaviour a characteristic timescale which potentially could tell us about the mass of the black hole is found in the xray variations from both agn and galactic black holes refs 16 but whether it is physically meaningful to compare the two has been questioned ref 7 here we report that after correcting for variations in the accretion rate the timescales can be physically linked revealing that the accretion process is exactly the same for small and large black holes strong support for this linkage comes perhaps surprisingly from the permitted optical emission lines in agn whose widths in both broadline agn and narrowemissionline seyfert 1 galaxies correlate strongly with the characteristic xray timescale exactly as expected from the agn black hole masses and accretion rates so agn really are just scaledup galactic black holes,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612273v1,Astronomy
the standard cold dark matter cdm model has recently been challenged by the claim that dwarf galaxies have dark matter halos with constant density cores consequently numerous alternative dark matter candidates have recently been proposed in this paper we scrutinize the observational evidence for the incongruity between dwarf galaxies and the cdm model to this end we analyze the rotation curves of 20 latetype dwarf galaxies studied by swaters 1999 taking the effects of beamsmearing and adiabatic contraction into account we fit mass models to these rotation curves with dark matter halos with different cusp slopes ranging from constant density cores to r2 cusps uncertainties in the stellar masstolight ratio and the limited spatial sampling of the halos density distribution hamper a unique mass decomposition consequently the rotation curves in our sample cannot be used to discriminate between dark halos with constant density cores and r1 cusps we show that the dwarf galaxies analyzed here are consistent with cold dark matter halos in a lcdm cosmology and that there is thus no need to abandon the idea that dark matter is cold and collisionless however the data is also consistent with any alternative dark matter model that produces dark matter halos with central cusps less steep than r15 in fact we argue that based on existing rotation curves alone at best weak limits can be obtained on cosmological parameters andor the nature of the dark matter,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0006048v2,Astronomy

combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto a galactic center with a highresolution nbodysph simulation we investigate the formation of an intermediate massive black hole imbh during the hierarchical formation of a small spiral galaxy with a total mass of 1010modot in the highz universe we found that the rate of average mass accretion to the nucleus due to the radiation drag exerted by newly formed stars in the forming galaxy is approx 105modotyr1 as a result of this accretion an imbh with approx 104modot can be formed in the center of the spiral galaxy at zsim 4 we found that a central bh coevolves with the dark matter halo from zsim 15 to zsim 2 the mass ratio of the bh to the dark matter halo is nearly constant approx 13 times 106 from zsim 10 to zsim 2 this is because that change in the dark matter potential enhances star formation in the central part of the galaxy and as a result the bh evolves due to mass accretion via the radiation drag therefore our model naturally predicts a correlation between massive bhs and dark matter halos moreover it is found that the final bhtobulge mass ratio approx 5times 105 in a small spiral galaxy at highz is much smaller than that in the large galaxies approx 103 our results also suggest that the scatter in the observed scaling relations between the bulge mass and black hole mass are caused by a time lag between bh growth and growth of bulge we also predict that the xray luminosity of agn is positively correlated with the co luminosity in the central region by comparing our results with the properties of lyman break galaxies lbgs it is predicted that some lbgs have massive bhs of approx 106107modot,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504202v1,Astronomy

we present a physical model for the coevolution of massive spheroidal galaxies and active nuclei at their centers supernova heating is increasingly effective in slowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows in smaller and smaller dark matter halos thus the more massive protogalaxies virializing at early times are the sites of faster star formation the correspondingly higher radiation drag causes a faster angular momentum loss by the gas and induces a larger accretion rate onto the central black hole in turn the kinetic energy of the outflows powered by the active nuclei can unbind the residual gas in a time shorter for larger halos the model accounts for a broad variety of dynamical photometric and metallicity properties of earlytype galaxies for the mbh sigma relation and for the local supermassive blackhole mass function,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409585v1,Astronomy

we have developed a consistent analytical model to describe the observed evolution of the quasar luminosity function our model combines black hole mass distributions based on the press schechter theory of the structure formation in the universe with quasar luminosity functions resulting from a physicsbased emission model that takes into account the timedependent phenomena occurring in the accretion disks quasar evolution and cdm models are mutually constraining therefore our model gives an estimation of the exponent n of the power spectrum pk which is found to be 18 n 16 we were able to reject a generally assumed hypothesis of a constant ratio between dark matter halo and the black hole mass since the observed data could not be fitted under this assumption we found that the relation between the dark matter halos and black hole masses is better described by mbhmdmh0668 this model provides a reasonable fit to the observed quasar luminosity function at redshifts higher than 20 we suggest that the disagreement at lower redshift is due to mergers based on the agreement at high redshift we estimated the merger rate at lower redshift and argue that this rate should depend on the redshift like 1z3,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009105v1,Astronomy

the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the galactic center gc may result in radio signals that can be used to detect or constrain the dark matter halo density profile or dark matter particle properties at the galactic center the accretion flow onto the central black hole bh sustains strong magnetic fields that can induce synchrotron emission by electrons and positrons generated in neutralino annihilations during advection onto the bh here we reanalyze the radiative processes relevant for the neutralino annihilation signal at the gc with realistic assumptions about the accretion flow and its magnetic properties we find that neglecting these effects as done in previous papers leads to the incorrent electron and photon spectra we find that the magnetic fields associated with the flow are significantly stronger than previously estimated we derive the appropriate equilibrium distribution of electrons and positron and the resulting radiation considering adiabatic compression in the accretion flow inverse compton scattering off synchrotron photons synchrotron selfcompton scattering and synchrotron selfabsorption of the emitted radiation we derive the signal for a navarrofrenkwhite nfw dark matter halo profile and a nfw profile with a dark matter spike due to the central bh we find that the observed radio emission from the gc is inconsistent with the scenario in which a spiky distribution of neutralinos is present we discuss several important differences between our calculations and those previously presented in the literature,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402588v2,Astronomy
this work develops and explores a quantumbased theory which enables the nature and origin of cold dark matter cdm to be understood without need to introduce exotic particles the quantum approach predicts the existence of certain macroscopic quantum structures that are wimplike even when occupied by traditional baryonic particles these structures function as dark matter candidates for cdm theory on large scales where it has been most successful and retain the potential to yield observationally compliant predictions on galactic cluster and subcluster scales relatively pure high angular momentum eigenstate solutions obtained from schrodingers equation in weak gravity form the structural basis they have no classical analogue and properties radically different from those of traditional localised matter whose eigenstate spectra contain negligible quantities of such states salient features include radiative lifetimes that can exceed the age of the universe energies and sizes consistent with galactic halos and negligible interaction rates with radiation and macroscopic galactic objects this facilitates the formation of sparsely populated macroscopic quantum structures that are invisible and stable viable structure formation scenarios are based on the seed potential wells of primordial black holes formed at the ee phase transition the structures can potentially produce suitable internal density distributions and have capacity to accommodate the required amount of halo dark matter the formation scenarios show that it is possible to incorporate structures into universal evolutionary scenarios without significantly compromising the results of wmap or the measurements of elemental bbn ratios,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406139v1,Astronomy
observations by the macho collaboration indicate that a significant fraction of the galactic halo dark matter may be in form of compact objects with masses msim 05modot identification of these objects as red or white dwarfs is problematic due to stringent observational upper limits on such dwarf populations primordial black hole pbh formation from preexisting density fluctuations is facilitated during the cosmic qcd transition due to a significant decrease in pressure forces for generic initial density perturbation spectra this implies that essentially all pbhs may form with masses close to the qcdhorizon scale mhqcdsim 1modot it is possible that such qcd pbhs contribute significantly to the closure density today i discuss the status of theoretical predictions for the properties of qcd pbh dark matter observational signatures of and constraints on a cosmic solar mass pbh population are also discussed,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805147v1,Astronomy
nerd abstract observational constraints on spacetime are reviewed focusing on how the underlying physics dark matter dark energy gravity can be tested rather than assumed popular abstract space is not a boring static stage on which events unfold over time but a dynamic entity with curvature fluctuations and a rich life of its own which is a booming area of study spectacular new measurements of the cosmic microwave background gravitational lensing type ia supernovae largescale structure spectra of the lyman alpha forest stellar dynamics and xray binaries are probing the properties of spacetime over 22 orders of magnitude in scale current measurements are consistent with an infinite flat everlasting universe containing about 30 cold dark matter 65 dark energy and at least two distinct populations of black holes,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207199v1,Astronomy
warm dark matter wdm models have recently been resurrected to resolve apparent conflicts of cold dark matter dm models with observations endowing the dm particles with nonnegligible velocities causes freestreaming which suppresses the primordial power spectrum on small scales the choice of a rootmeansquare velocity dispersion vrms 005 kms at redshift z0 corresponding to a particle mass of 1 kev if the wdm particles are fermions decoupling while relativistic helps alleviate most but probably not all of the smallscale problems faced by cdm an important sideeffect of the particle velocities is the severe decrease in the number of collapsed halos at high redshift this is caused both by the loss of smallscale power and by the delay in the collapse of the smallest individual halos with masses near the effective jeans mass of the dm the presence of early halos is required in order 1 to host either early quasars or galaxies that can reionize the universe by redshift z58 and 2 to allow the growth of the supermassive black hole believed to power the recently discovered quasar sdss 10441215 at this redshift we quantify these constraints using a modified pressschechter formalism and find vrms 1 kev if future observations uncover massive black holes at z 10 or reveal that reionization occurred at z 10 this could conclusively rule out wdm models as the solution to the smallscale crisis of the cdm paradigm,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103050v1,Astronomy
we investigate the relationship between the mass and velocity fields of the intergalactic medium igm and dark matter although the evolution of the igm is dynamically governed by the gravity of the underlying dark matter field some statistical properties of the igm inevitably decouple from those of the dark matter once the nonlinearity of the dynamical equations and the stochastic nature of the field is considered with simulation samples produced by a hybrid cosmological hydrodynamicnbody code which is effective in capturing shocks and complicated structures with high precision we find that the onepoint distributions of the igm field are systematically different from that of dark matter as follows 1 the onepoint distribution of the igm peculiar velocity field is exponential at least at redshifts less than 2 while the dark matter velocity field is close to a gaussian field 2 although the onepoint distributions of the igm and dark matter are similar the pointbypoint correlation between the igm and dark matter density fields significantly differs on all scales and redshifts analyzed 3 the onepoint density distributions of the difference between igm and dark matter fields are highly nongaussian and long tailed these discrepancies violate the similarity between the igm and dark matter and cannot be explained simply as jeans smoothing of the igm however these statistical discrepancies are consistent with the fluids described by stochasticforce driven nonlinear dynamics,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405508v1,Astronomy
cold dark matter cdm has become the standard modern theory of cosmological structure formation its predictions appear to be in good agreement with data on large scales and it naturally accounts for many properties of galaxies but despite its many successes there has been concern about cdm on small scales because of the possible contradiction between the linearly rising rotation curves observed in some darkmatterdominated galaxies vs the 1r density cusps at the centers of simulated cdm halos other cdm issues on small scales include the very large number of small satellite halos in simulations far more than the number of small galaxies observed locally and problems concerning the angular momentum of the baryons in dark matter halos the latest data and simulations have lessened although not entirely resolved these concerns meanwhile the main alternatives to cdm that have been considered to solve these problems selfinteracting dark matter sidm and warm dark matter wdm have been found to have serious drawbacks,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205391v1,Astronomy
it is shown that contrary to the widespread opinion particle collisions considerably increase accretion rate from the cosmological background onto 5d primordial black holes formed during the highenergy phase of the randallsundrum type ii braneworld scenario increase of accretion rate leads to much tighter constraints on initial primordial black hole mass fraction imposed by the critical density limit and measurements of highenergy diffuse photon background and antiproton excess,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510212v2,Astronomy
we discuss the various ways in which primordial black holes may have formed in the early universe and how the effects of such black holes can be used to place constraints on cosmological models we show that such constraints may be severely modified if the value of the gravitational constant g varies with cosmological epoch a possibility which arises in many scenarios for the early universe the nature of the modification depends upon whether the value of g near a black hole maintains the value it had at its formation epoch corresponding to gravitational memory or whether it tracks the background cosmological value this is still uncertain but we discuss various approaches which might help to resolve the issue,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003027v1,Astronomy
the formation of quasar black holes during the hydrodynamic collapse of protogalactic gas clouds is discussed the dissipational collapse and long term dynamical evolution of these systems is analysed using threedimensional numerical simulations the calculations focus on the final collapse stages of the inner baryonic component and therefore ignore the presence of dark matter two types of initial conditions are considered uniformly rotating spherical clouds and irrotational ellipsoidal clouds in both cases the clouds are initially cold homogeneous and not far from rotational support tw approx 01 although the details of the dynamical evolution depend sensitively on the initial conditions the qualitative features of the final configurations do not most of the gas is found to fragment into small dense clumps that eventually make up a spheroidal component resembling a galactic bulge about 5 of the initial mass remains in the form of a smooth disk of gas supported by rotation in the gravitational potential well of the outer spheroid if a central seed black hole of mass gsim106modot forms it can grow by steady accretion from the disk and reach a typical quasar black hole mass sim108modot in less than 5times 108yr in the absence of a sufficiently massive seed dynamical instabilities in a strongly self gravitating inner region of the disk will inhibit steady accretion of gas and may prevent the immediate formation of a quasar,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9401026v1,Astronomy
we study the imprints of agn feedback and physical viscosity on the properties of galaxy clusters using hydrodynamical simulation models carried out with the treesph code gadget2 besides selfgravity of dark matter and baryons our approach includes radiative cooling and heating processes of the gas component and a multiphase model for star formation and sne feedback additionally we introduce a prescription for physical viscosity in gadget2 based on a sph discretization of the navierstokes and general heat transfer equations adopting the braginskii parameterization for the shear viscosity coefficient we explore how gas viscosity influences the properties of agndriven bubbles we also introduce a novel selfconsistent agn feedback model where we simultaneously follow the growth and energy release of massive black holes embedded in a cluster environment we assume that black holes accreting at low rates with respect to the eddington limit are in a radiatively inefficient regime and that most of the feedback energy will appear in a mechanical form thus we introduce agndriven bubbles into the icm with properties such as radius and energy content that are directly linked to the black hole physics this model leads to a selfregulated mechanism for the black hole growth and overcomes the cooling flow problem in host halos ranging from the scale of groups to that of massive clusters abridged,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610907v1,Astronomy
one of the central features of the last 8 to 10 billion years of cosmic history has been the emergence of a wellpopulated red sequence of nonstarforming galaxies a number of models of galaxy formation and evolution have been devised to attempt to explain this behavior most current models require feedback from supermassive black holes agn feedback to quench star formation in galaxies in the centers of their dark matter halos central galaxies such models make the strong prediction that all quenched central galaxies must have a large supermassive black hole and by association a prominent bulge component i show using data from the sloan digital sky survey that the observations are consistent with this prediction over 995 of red sequence galaxies with stellar masses in excess of 1010 msun have a prominent bulge component as defined by having a sersic index n above 15 those very rare red sequence central galaxies with little or no bulge n15 usually have detectable star formation or agn activity the fraction of truly quenched bulgeless central galaxies is 01 of the total red sequence population i conclude that a bulge and by implication a supermassive black hole is an absolute requirement for full quenching of star formation in central galaxies this is in agreement with the most basic prediction of the agn feedback paradigm,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4001v1,Astronomy
we investigate the distribution of dark matter dm in gasrich lowmass galaxies confronting them with numerical cosmological simulations with cold dark matter lcdm we show that the derived rotation curves comply best with cored dm density profiles whereas the signatures of the central cusps invariably predicted by lcdm simulations are not seen,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.4289v1,Astronomy
reasons supporting the idea that most of the dark matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is baryonic is discussed moreover it is argued that most of the dark matter in galactic halo should be in the form of machos and cold molecular clouds,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9610031v1,Astronomy
we present constraints on the density of halo dark matter candidates within the solar circle based on the anisotropy in the high energy gammaray background the known galactic components of the gammaray background in particular the inverse compton component have been estimated more accurately we find the spectrum of the residual emission after subtracting the galactic component is inconsistent with emission from some of the proposed dark matter candidates we derive upper limits of 108 msun for the mass of diffuse gas and 3109 pc3 for the number density of primordial black holes contributing to the gammaray background,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811324v1,Astronomy
i demonstrate that precision timing of millisecond pulsars possess the capabilities of detecting the gravitational effects of intervening galactic substructure this analysis is applicable to all types of collapsed baryons including stars planets and machos as well as many types of dark matter including primordial black holes scalar miniclusters and sufficiently dense clumps of cold dark matter the physical signal is quantified and decomposed into observable and unobservable components templates for the observable signals are also presented additionally i calculate the expected changes in the observed period and period derivatives that will result from intervening matter i find that pulsar timing is potentially a very useful tool for probing the nature of dark matter and to learn more about the substructure present within our galaxy,http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3458v1,Astronomy
