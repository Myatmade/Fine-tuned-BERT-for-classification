there is a growing interest in hci to envision design and evaluate technologyenabled interventions that support users emotion regulation this interest stems in part from increased recognition that the ability to regulate emotions is critical to mental health and that a lack of effective emotion regulation is a transdiagnostic factor for mental illness however the potential to combine innovative hci designs with the theoretical grounding and stateofart interventions from psychology has yet to be fully realised in this paper we synthesise hci work on emotion regulation interventions and propose a threepart framework to guide technology designers in making i theoryinformed decisions about intervention targets ii strategic decisions regarding the technologyenabled intervention mechanisms to be included in the system and iii practical decisions around previous implementations of the selected intervention components we show how this framework can both systematise hci work to date and suggest a research agenda for future work,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00118v2,Psychology

in this paper we provide causal evidence on abortions and risky health behaviors as determinants of mental health development among young women using administrative in and outpatient records from sweden we apply a novel grouped fixedeffects estimator proposed by bonhomme and manresa 2015 to allow for timevarying unobserved heterogeneity we show that the positive association obtained from standard estimators shrinks to zero once we control for grouped timevarying unobserved heterogeneity we estimate the groupspecific profiles of unobserved heterogeneity which reflect differences in unobserved risk to be diagnosed with a mental health condition we then analyze mental health development and risky health behaviors other than unwanted pregnancies across groups our results suggest that these are determined by the same type of unobserved heterogeneity which we attribute to the same unobserved process of decisionmaking we develop and estimate a theoretical model of risky choices and mental health in which mental health disparity across groups is generated by different degrees of selfcontrol problems our findings imply that mental health concerns cannot be used to justify restrictive abortion policies moreover potential selfcontrol problems should be targeted as early as possible to combat future mental health consequences,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12159v4,Psychology
emotion regulation is a crucial element in dealing with emotional events and has positive effects on mental health this paper aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of emotional events by introducing a new french corpus of emotional narratives collected using a questionnaire for emotion regulation we follow the theoretical framework of the component process model which considers emotions as dynamic processes composed of four interrelated components behavior feeling thinking and territory each narrative is related to a discrete emotion and is structured based on all emotion components by the writers we study the interaction of components and their impact on emotion classification with machine learning methods and pretrained language models our results show that each component improves prediction performance and that the best results are achieved by jointly considering all components our results also show the effectiveness of pretrained language models in predicting discrete emotion from certain components which reveal differences in how emotion components are expressed,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10446v1,Psychology
in cognitive psychology automatic and selfreinforcing irrational thought patterns are known as cognitive distortions left unchecked patients exhibiting these types of thoughts can become stuck in negative feedback loops of unhealthy thinking leading to inaccurate perceptions of reality commonly associated with anxiety and depression in this paper we present a machine learning framework for the automatic detection and classification of 15 common cognitive distortions in two novel mental health free text datasets collected from both crowdsourcing and a realworld online therapy program when differentiating between distorted and nondistorted passages our model achieved a weighted f1 score of 088 for classifying distorted passages into one of 15 distortion categories our model yielded weighted f1 scores of 068 in the larger crowdsourced dataset and 045 in the smaller online counseling dataset both of which outperformed random baseline metrics by a large margin for both tasks we also identified the most discriminative words and phrases between classes to highlight common thematic elements for improving targeted and therapistguided mental health treatment furthermore we performed an exploratory analysis using unsupervised contentbased clustering and topic modeling algorithms as first efforts towards a datadriven perspective on the thematic relationship between similar cognitive distortions traditionally deemed unique finally we highlight the difficulties in applying mental healthbased machine learning in a realworld setting and comment on the implications and benefits of our framework for improving automated delivery of therapeutic treatment in conjunction with traditional cognitivebehavioral therapy,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07502v2,Psychology

emerging psychopathology studies are showing that patterns of changes in emotional state emotion dynamics are associated with overall wellbeing and mental health more recently there has been some work in tracking emotion dynamics through ones utterances allowing for data to be collected on a larger scale across time and people however several questions about how emotion dynamics change with age especially in children and when determined through childrens writing remain unanswered in this work we use both a lexicon and a machine learning based approach to quantify characteristics of emotion dynamics determined from poems written by children of various ages we show that both approaches point to similar trends consistent increasing intensities for some emotions eg anger fear joy sadness arousal and dominance with age and a consistent decreasing valence with age we also find increasing emotional variability rise rates ie emotional reactivity and recovery rates ie emotional regulation with age these results act as a useful baselines for further research in how patterns of emotions expressed by children change with age and their association with mental health,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05387v1,Psychology
the ability to regulate and cope with strong emotions is essential for maintaining our mental health and wellbeing however learning how to emotionally regulate can be a bit of a mystery since it is largely an invisible process and it can be difficult to conjure up strong emotions to practice regulating them this is where virtual reality or vr comes in vr is a computergenerated 3d environment where the user experiences a simulated world through 360 visuals stereo audio and 3d interaction with tracking sensors vr is a very visceral experience that feels real even though you know it isnt if a virtual ball came flying at your head you would duck my past research shows that we can provide vr experiences that elicit strong emotional reactions so that people can practice coping and regulating their emotional responses for example i helped create a vr experience of being in nature and then going into space to see the earth it created the emotional reaction of awe and wonder that led to a deeper connection with our planet this shows that emotional vr experiences can impact our emotions and behaviour both in vr and beyond my research proposal is to investigate the feasibility of emotion regulation skills development in vr with teenagers the idea is to simulate emotional experiences like the 1st day of high school as a means to develop emotion regulation skills so that they will be able to better cope with their emotions i will lead the design development and evaluation of this vr experience and work directly with youth to meet their needs this proof of concept prototype is the first step in developing a vr platform that provides youth with an effective way to regulate their emotions and improve their mental health from their own homes which will lead to improvements in education socioemotional and economic outcomes for youth in canada and globally,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00002v1,Psychology
recently foundational issues of applicability of the formalism of quantum mechanics qm to cognitive psychology decision making and psychophysics attracted a lot of interest in particular in citedkbb the possibility to use of the projection postulate and representation of mental observables by hermitian operators was discussed in very detail the main conclusion of the recent discussions on the foundations of quantumlike cognitive psychology is that one has to be careful in determination of conditions of applicability of the projection postulate as a mathematical tool for description of measurements of observables represented by hermitian operators to represent some statistical experimental data both physical and mental in the quantumlike way one has to use generalized quantum observables given by positive operatorvalued measures povms this paper contains a brief review on povms which can be useful for newcomers to the field of quantumlike studies especially interesting for cognitive psychology is a variant of the formula of total probability ftp with the interference term derived for incompatible observables given by povms we present an interpretation of the interference term from the psychological viewpoint as was shown before the appearance of such a term perturbing classical ftp plays the important role in cognitive psychology eg recognition of ambiguous figures and the disjunction effect the interference term for observables given by povms has much more complicated structure than the corresponding term for observables given by hermitian operators we elaborate cognitive interpretations of different components of the povmsinterference term and apply our analysis to a quantumlike model of decision making,http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1269v1,Psychology
automatic depression detection on twitter can help individuals privately and conveniently understand their mental health status in the early stages before seeing mental health professionals most existing blackboxlike deep learning methods for depression detection largely focused on improving classification performance however explaining model decisions is imperative in health research because decisionmaking can often be highstakes and lifeanddeath reliable automatic diagnosis of mental health problems including depression should be supported by credible explanations justifying models predictions in this work we propose a novel explainable model for depression detection on twitter it comprises a novel encoder combining hierarchical attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks to support psycholinguistic studies our model leverages metaphorical concept mappings as input thus it not only detects depressed individuals but also identifies features of such users tweets and associated metaphor concept mappings,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07494v1,Psychology

phd students report a higher prevalence of mental illness symptoms than highly educated individuals in the general population this situation presents a serious problem for universities thus the knowledge about this phenomenon is of great importance in decisionmaking in this paper we use the nature phd survey 2019 and estimate several binomial logistic regression models to analyze the risk of interrupting doctoral studies this risk is measured through the desire of change in either the supervisor or the area of expertise or the wish of not pursue a phd among the explanatory factors we focus on the influence of anxietydepression discrimination and bullying as control variables we use demographic characteristics and others related with the doctoral program insufficient contact time with supervisors and exceeding time spent studying crossing the 50h week barrier are risk factors of phd studies interruption but the most decisive risk factor is poor mental health universities should therefore foster an environment of wellbeing which allows the development of autonomy and resilience of their phd students or when necessary which fosters the development of conflict resolution skills,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07039v1,Psychology

mental health stigma prevents many individuals from receiving the appropriate care and social psychology studies have shown that mental health tends to be overlooked in men in this work we investigate gendered mental health stigma in masked language models in doing so we operationalize mental health stigma by developing a framework grounded in psychology research we use clinical psychology literature to curate prompts then evaluate the models propensity to generate gendered words we find that masked language models capture societal stigma about gender in mental health models are consistently more likely to predict female subjects than male in sentences about having a mental health condition 32 vs 19 and this disparity is exacerbated for sentences that indicate treatmentseeking behavior furthermore we find that different models capture dimensions of stigma differently for men and women associating stereotypes like anger blame and pity more with women with mental health conditions than with men in showing the complex nuances of models gendered mental health stigma we demonstrate that context and overlapping dimensions of identity are important considerations when assessing computational models social biases,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15144v2,Psychology
probabilistic graphical models such as bayesian networks are one of the most powerful structures known by the computer science community for deriving probabilistic inferences however modern cognitive psychology has revealed that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical probability theory because humans cannot process large amounts of data in order to make judgements consequently the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics leading to violations of the law of total probability this means that probabilistic graphical models based on classical probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various aspects of human decision making quantum probability theory was developed in order to accommodate the paradoxical findings that the classical theory could not explain recent findings in cognitive psychology revealed that quantum probability can fully describe human decisions in an elegant framework their findings suggest that before taking a decision human thoughts are seen as superposed waves that can interfere with each other influencing the final decision in this work we propose a new bayesian network based on the psychological findings of cognitive scientists we made experiments with two very well known bayesian networks from the literature the results obtained revealed that the quantum like bayesian network can affect drastically the probabilistic inferences specially when the levels of uncertainty of the network are very high no pieces of evidence observed when the levels of uncertainty are very low then the proposed quantum like network collapses to its classical counterpart,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8470v1,Psychology

large language models llms have gradually become the gateway for people to acquire new knowledge however attackers can break the models security protection jail to access restricted information which is called jailbreaking previous studies have shown the weakness of current llms when confronted with such jailbreaking attacks nevertheless comprehension of the intrinsic decisionmaking mechanism within the llms upon receipt of jailbreak prompts is noticeably lacking our research provides a psychological explanation of the jailbreak prompts drawing on cognitive consistency theory we argue that the key to jailbreak is guiding the llm to achieve cognitive coordination in an erroneous direction further we propose an automatic blackbox jailbreaking method based on the footinthedoor fitd technique this method progressively induces the model to answer harmful questions via multistep incremental prompts we instantiated a prototype system to evaluate the jailbreaking effectiveness on 8 advanced llms yielding an average success rate of 839 this study builds a psychological perspective on the explanatory insights into the intrinsic decisionmaking logic of llms,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15690v1,Psychology
more than 1 million students play high school american football annually but many health professionals have recently questioned its safety or called for its ban these concerns have been partially driven by reports of chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte increased risks of neurodegenerative disease and associations between concussion history and laterlife cognitive impairment and depression among retired professional football players a recent observational study of a cohort of men who graduated from a wisconsin high school in 1957 found no statistically significant harmful effects of playing high school football on a range of cognitive psychological and socioeconomic outcomes measured at ages 35 54 65 and 72 unfortunately these findings may not generalize to younger populations thanks to changes and improvements in football helmet technology and training techniques in particular these changes may have led to increased perceptions of safety but ultimately more dangerous styles of play characterized by the frequent subconcussive impacts thought to be associated with laterlife neurological decline in this work we replicate the methodology of that earlier matched observational study using data from the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health add health these include adolescent and family comorbidities academic experience selfreported levels of general health and physical activity and the score on the add health picture vocabulary test our primary outcome is the cesd score measured in 2008 when subjects were aged 24 34 and settling into early adulthood we also examine several secondary outcomes related to physical and psychological health including suicidality our results can provide insight into the natural history of potential footballrelated decline and dysfunction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03934v2,Psychology
mental health challenges are thought to afflict around 10 of the global population each year with many going untreated due to stigma and limited access to services here we explore trends in words and phrases related to mental health through a collection of 1 2 and 3grams parsed from a data stream of roughly 10 of all english tweets since 2012 we examine temporal dynamics of mental health language finding that the popularity of the phrase mental health increased by nearly two orders of magnitude between 2012 and 2018 we observe that mentions of mental health spike annually and reliably due to mental health awareness campaigns as well as unpredictably in response to mass shootings celebrities dying by suicide and popular fictional stories portraying suicide we find that the level of positivity of messages containing mental health while stable through the growth period has declined recently finally we use the ratio of original tweets to retweets to quantify the fraction of appearances of mental health language due to social amplification since 2015 mentions of mental health have become increasingly due to retweets suggesting that stigma associated with discussion of mental health on twitter has diminished with time,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01481v1,Psychology

the empirical risk minimization approach to datadriven decision making requires access to training data drawn under the same conditions as those that will be faced when the decision rule is deployed however in a number of settings we may be concerned that our training sample is biased in the sense that some groups characterized by either observable or unobservable attributes may be under or overrepresented relative to the general population and in this setting empirical risk minimization over the training set may fail to yield rules that perform well at deployment we propose a model of sampling bias called conditional gammabiased sampling where observed covariates can affect the probability of sample selection arbitrarily much but the amount of unexplained variation in the probability of sample selection is bounded by a constant factor applying the distributionally robust optimization framework we propose a method for learning a decision rule that minimizes the worstcase risk incurred under a family of test distributions that can generate the training distribution under gammabiased sampling we apply a result of rockafellar and uryasev to show that this problem is equivalent to an augmented convex risk minimization problem we give statistical guarantees for learning a model that is robust to sampling bias via the method of sieves and propose a deep learning algorithm whose loss function captures our robust learning target we empirically validate our proposed method in a case study on prediction of mental health scores from health survey data and a case study on icu length of stay prediction,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01754v3,Psychology

neurofeedback is a noninvasive brain training with longterm medical and nonmedical applications despite the existence of several emotion regulation studies using neurofeedback further investigation is needed to understand interactions of the brain regions involved in the process we implemented eeg neurofeedback with simultaneous fmri using a modified happinessinducing task through autobiographical memories to upregulate positive emotion the results showed increased activity of prefrontal occipital parietal and limbic regions and increased functional connectivity between prefrontal parietal limbic system and insula in the experimental group new connectivity links were identified by comparing the functional connectivity of different experimental conditions within the experimental group and between the experimental and control groups the proposed multimodal approach quantified the changes in the brain activity up to 19 increase and connectivity fdrcorrected for multiple comparison q 005 during emotion regulation inbetween prefrontal parietal limbic and insula regions psychometric assessments confirmed significant changes in positive and negative mood states by neurofeedback with a pvalue smaller than 0002 in the experimental group this study quantifies the effects of eeg neurofeedback in changing functional connectivity of all brain regions involved in emotion regulation for the brain regions involved in emotion regulation we found significant bold and functional connectivity increases due to neurofeedback in the experimental group but no learning effect was observed in the control group the results reveal the neurobiological substrate of emotion regulation by the eeg neurofeedback and separate the effect of the neurofeedback and the recall of the autobiographical memories,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06829v1,Psychology
delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium for longterm health behavior management but active experimentation of treatment options can be timeconsuming expensive and altogether unethical in some cases there is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment we present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using realworld historical mobile digital data from n 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies we explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people we also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models to this complex realworld data including which contextual features appear to be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09472v1,Psychology
