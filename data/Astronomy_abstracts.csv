"Primordial stars are likely to be very massive $\geq30\Msun$, form in
isolation, and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of
their host dark matter halos in the mass range
  $10^{6}-10^{10}\Ms$. Such early black holes, at redshifts z$\gtsim10$, could
be the seed black holes for the many supermassive black holes found in galaxies
in the local universe. If they exist, their mergers with nearby supermassive
black holes may be a prime signal for long wavelength gravitational wave
detectors. We simulate formation of black holes in the center of high redshift
dark matter halos and explore implications of initial natal kick velocities
conjectured by some formation models. The central concentration of early black
holes in present day galaxies is reduced if they are born even with moderate
kicks of tens of km/s. The modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their
parent halo, which consequently leads to dynamical friction being less
effective on the lower mass black holes as compared to those still embedded in
their parent halos. Therefore, merger rates may be reduced by more than an
order of magnitude. Using analytical and illustrative cosmological N--body
simulations we quantify the role of natal kicks of black holes formed from
massive metal free stars on their merger rates with supermassive black holes in
present day galaxies. Our results also apply to black holes ejected by the
gravitational slingshot mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512123v2
"In this article we consider the growth of seed black holes immersed in dark
matter halos. We first investigate the adiabatic growth in various initial
distribution functions (isothermal, power law, and NFW) and find the resulting
density, radial velocity, and anisotropy profiles. In addition we estimate the
growth rate for a given black hole mass in the corresponding adiabatically
modified dark matter distribution function. Only in the isothermal case is
there a convincing black hole mass-age relation. By calculating the line of
sight velocity dispersion for the various cases as a function of the black hole
mass, we find the predicted adiabatic $M_{bh}-\sigma$ relation; this never
approaches the recently observed power law. We conclude by abandoning
adiabaticity, suggesting that the black hole grows proportionally to the dark
matter halo itself on a dynamic time scale. This allows us to relate the
observed $M_{bh}-\sigma$ relation to the cosmological power spectrum on
galactic scales by using dimensional scaling arguments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201153v1

"The first massive astrophysical black holes likely formed at high redshifts
(z>10) at the centers of low mass (~10^6 Msun) dark matter concentrations.
These black holes grow by mergers and gas accretion, evolve into the population
of bright quasars observed at lower redshifts, and eventually leave the
supermassive black hole remnants that are ubiquitous at the centers of galaxies
in the nearby universe. The astrophysical processes responsible for the
formation of the earliest seed black holes are poorly understood. The purpose
of this review is threefold: (1) to describe theoretical expectations for the
formation and growth of the earliest black holes within the general paradigm of
hierarchical cold dark matter cosmologies, (2) to summarize several relevant
recent observations that have implications for the formation of the earliest
black holes, and (3) to look into the future and assess the power of
forthcoming observations to probe the physics of the first active galactic
nuclei.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403225v1
"Primordial stars are likely to be very massive >30 Msun, form in isolation,
and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of their host dark
matter halos. We expect primordial stars to form in halos in the mass range
10^6-10^10 Msun. Some of these early black holes, formed at redshifts z>10,
could be the seed black hole for a significant fraction of the supermassive
black holes found in galaxies in the local universe. If the black hole
descendants of the primordial stars exist, their mergers with nearby
supermassive black holes may be a prime candidate for long wavelength
gravitational wave detectors. We simulate formation and evolution of dark
matter halos in LambdaCDM universe. We seed high-redshift dark matter halos
with early black holes, and explore the merger history of the host halos and
the implications of black hole's kick velocities arising from their
coalescence. The central concentration of low mass early black holes in present
day galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of km/s.
Even such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which
consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the low mass
black holes that were ejected, compared to those still embedded in their parent
halos. Therefore, merger rates with central supermassive black holes in the
largest halos may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using
analytical and illustrative cosmological N-body simulations, we quantify the
role of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal free
stars with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0609443v2
"If the cosmological dark matter has a component made of small primordial
black holes, they may have a significant impact on the physics of the first
stars and on the subsequent formation of massive black holes. Primordial black
holes would be adiabatically contracted into these stars and then would sink to
the stellar center by dynamical friction, creating a larger black hole which
may quickly swallow the whole star. If these primordial black holes are heavier
than $\sim 10^{22} {\rm g}$, the first stars would likely live only for a very
short time and would not contribute much to the reionization of the universe.
They would instead become $10 - 10^3 M_\odot$ black holes which (depending on
subsequent accretion) could serve as seeds for the super--massive black holes
seen at high redshifts as well as those inside galaxies today.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0585v2
"The relativistic accretion rate of dark matter by a black hole is revisited.
Under the assumption that the phase space density indicator,
$Q=\rho_{\infty}/\sigma^3_{\infty}$, remains constant during the inflow, the
derived accretion rate can be higher up to five orders of magnitude than the
classical accretion formula, valid for non-relativistic and non-interacting
particles, when typical dark halo conditions are considered. For these typical
conditions, the critical point of the flow is located at distances of about
30-150 times the horizon radius. Application of our results to black hole seeds
hosted by halos issued from cosmological simulations indicate that dark matter
contributes to no more than ~10% of the total accreted mass, confirming that
the bolometric quasar luminosity is related to the baryonic accretion history
of the black hole.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2041v1
"If the cosmological dark matter is primarily in the form of an elementary
particle which has cross section and mass for self-interaction having a ratio
similar to that of ordinary nuclear matter, then seed black holes (formed in
stellar collapse) will grow in a Hubble time, due to accretion of the dark
matter, to a mass range 10^6 - 10^9 solar masses. Furthermore, the dependence
of the final black hole mass on the galaxy velocity dispersion will be
approximately as observed and the growth rate will show a time dependence
consistent with observations. Other astrophysical consequences of collisional
dark matter and tests of the idea are noted.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9912548v2
"Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are nowadays believed to reside in most
local galaxies, and the available data show an empirical correlation between
bulge luminosity - or stellar velocity dispersion - and black hole mass,
suggesting a single mechanism for assembling black holes and forming spheroids
in galaxy halos. The evidence is therefore in favour of a co-evolution between
galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold dark matter cosmogonies, small-mass
subgalactic systems form first to merge later into larger and larger
structures. In this paradigm galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during
their lifetime. If every galaxy with a bulge hosts a SMBH in its center, and a
local galaxy has been made up by multiple mergers, then a black hole binary is
a natural evolutionary stage. The evolution of the supermassive black hole
population clearly has to be investigated taking into account both the
cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and their hosts.
The seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the early Universe, as very
luminous quasars are detected up to redshift higher than z=6. These black holes
evolve then in a hierarchical fashion, following the merger hierarchy of their
host halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays a fundamental
role in determining the two parameters defining a black hole: mass and spin. A
particularly intriguing epoch is the initial phase of SMBH growth. It is very
challenging to meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
very high rates in their infancy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602630v1
"Understanding how seed black holes grow into intermediate and supermassive
black holes (IMBHs and SMBHs, respectively) has important implications for the
duty-cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), galaxy evolution, and gravitational
wave astronomy. Most studies of the cosmological growth and merger history of
black holes have used semianalytic models and have concentrated on SMBH growth
in luminous galaxies. Using high resolution cosmological N-body simulations, we
track the assembly of black holes over a large range of final masses -- from
seed black holes to SMBHs -- over widely varying dynamical histories. We used
the dynamics of dark matter halos to track the evolution of seed black holes in
three different gas accretion scenarios. We have found that growth of
Sagittarius A* - size SMBH reaches its maximum mass M_{SMBH}~10^6Msun at z~6
through early gaseous accretion episodes, after which it stays at near constant
mass. At the same redshift, the duty-cycle of the host AGN ends, hence redshift
z=6 marks the transition from an AGN to a starburst galaxy which eventually
becomes the Milky Way. By tracking black hole growth as a function of time and
mass, we estimate that the IMBH merger rate reaches a maximum of R_{max}=55
yr^-1 at z=11. From IMBH merger rates we calculate N_{ULX}=7 per Milky Way type
galaxy per redshift in redshift range 2<z<6.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703540v1
"It is argued that supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies most
likely have grown coevally with their host dark matter halos. A calculation
based on Press-Schechter within this framework shows that the mean rate of
accretion of matter onto such black holes varies from a value about 0.003 of
the Eddington rate at the present epoch to a value around 0.08 at redshift 3.
The bulk of AGN evolution may be explained as a reflection of the diminishing
rate of accretion of material onto galaxies. The result is almost independent
of mass of host dark matter halo and is only weakly dependent on the values of
cosmological parameters. At high redshifts, z greater than about 5, black holes
in galaxies would have been accreting close to the Eddington limit, which is
likely to lead to galactic outflows being ubiquitous at those epochs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506591v2
"Phase transitions in the early universe are prime settings for the production
of primordial black holes, since they can break the relatively quiescent
homogeneity and isotropy of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmologies. These
epochs of ""symmetry breaking,"" moreover, can affect the subsequent development
of spacetime by changing the evolution of some FRW parameters, including the
present age and density of the universe. We discuss the relative importance of
such effects on constraining mechanisms of black hole formation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003062v1
"We investigate the coupled formation and evolution of galaxies and their
embedded supermassive black holes using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic
simulations of cosmological structure formation. For the first time, we
self-consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative gas cooling, star
formation, as well as black hole growth and associated feedback processes,
starting directly from initial conditions appropriate for the LambdaCDM
cosmology. Our modeling of the black hole physics is based on an approach we
have developed in simulations of isolated galaxy mergers. Here we examine: (i)
the predicted global history of black hole mass assembly (ii) the evolution of
the local black hole-host mass correlations and (iii) the conditions that allow
rapid growth of the first quasars, and the properties of their hosts and
descendants today. We find a total black hole mass density in good agreement
with observational estimates. The black hole accretion rate density peaks at
lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than the star
formation rate density, but the ratio of black hole to stellar mass densities
shows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find strong correlations
between black hole masses and properties of the stellar systems, agreeing well
with the measured local M_BH-sigma and M_BH -M_* relationships, but also
suggesting (dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in the
normalization and the slope. Our simulations also produce massive black holes
at high redshift, due to extended periods of exponential growth in regions that
collapse early and exhibit strong gas inflows. These first supermassive BH
systems however are not necessarily the most massive ones today, since they are
often overtaken in growth by quasars that form later. (abridged)",http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2269v1
"We study a cosmological model in which the boson dark matter gradually
condensates into dark energy. Negative pressure associated with the condensate
yields the accelerated expansion of the Universe and the rapid collapse of the
smallest scale fluctuations into many black holes, which become the seeds of
the first galaxies. The cycle of gradual sedimentation and rapid collapse of
condensate repeats many times and self-regularizes the ratio of dark energy and
dark matter to be order one.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403571v1
"The physical basis of the modern cosmological inflationary models with
baryosynthesis and nonbaryonic dark matter and energy implies such predictions
of particle theory, that, in turn, apply to cosmology for their test. It makes
physics of early Universe ambiguous and particle model dependent. The study of
modern cosmology is inevitably linked with the probe for the new physics,
underlying it. The particle model dependent phenomena, such as unstable dark
matter, primordial black holes, strong primordial inhomogeneities, can play
important role in revealing the true physical cosmology. Such phenomena, having
serious physical grounds and leading to new nontrivial cosmological scenarious,
should be taken into account in the data analysis of observational cosmology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309703v1
"This poster discusses a possible explanation for the relationship between the
mass of the central supermassive black hole and the velocity dispersion in the
bulge of the host galaxy. We suppose that the black hole and the dark matter
halo are forming simultaneously as matter falls in, and a self-similar system
then exists in which the mass and the velocities of the system evolve as
power-law functions of time. This leads naturally to a relationship between the
black hole mass and the velocities in the halo which, with a reasonable choice
of cosmological parameters, is in good agreement with the observed
relationship. We also confirm this relationship with more robust numerical
results.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212278v2
"We describe the model of protogalaxy formation around the cluster of
primordial black holes with a minimum extension of standard cosmological model.
Namely, it is supposed, that a mass fraction of the universe ~10^-3 is composed
of the compact clusters of primordial (relict) black holes produced during the
phase transitions in the early universe. These clusters are the centers of the
dark matter (DM) condensations. As a result the protogalaxies with a mass
2x10^8Msun form at the redshift z=15. These induced protogalaxies contain the
central black holes of mass ~10^5Msun and look like the dwarf spheroidal
galaxies with a central density spike. Subsequent merging of the induced
protogalaxies and ordinary DM haloes leads to the standard scenario of the
large scale structure formation. Black holes merging gives the nowadays
supermassive black holes and reproduces the observed correlations between their
masses and velocity dispersions in the bulges.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412479v1
"This work is related to different questions within cosmology. The principal
idea herein is to develop cosmological knowledge making use of the analyses of
observational data in order to find the values of the matter density Omega_m
and vacuum energy density Omega_Lambda.
  Data fitting is carried out using two statistical methods, chi^2 and maximum
likelihood. The data analysis exhibits that a low density and flat Universe is
strongly favoured.
  Applying the Omega_m value found for clusters of galaxies, we demonstrate
that clusters have very little room for baryonic dark matter. An upper limit to
the small but non-negligible sum of baryonic dark matter and galaxy mass can be
estimated, requiring the use of special statistics.
  A Toroidal Black Hole (TBH) study, in contrast to the Spherical Black Hole
(SBH), shows that the TBH can be used as an important tool in explaining AGN
phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210253v1
"We incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holes
into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies
in a cold dark matter dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black
holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of
comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few percent of
the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a
timescale of a few times 10^7 years. With these simple assumptions, our model
not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also
reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and
black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar
population with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearby
quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number
density of quasars from z=2 to z=0 is due to the combination of three effects:
i) a decrease in the merging rate, ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas
available to fuel black holes, and iii) an increase in the timescale for gas
accretion. In a LCDM cosmology the predicted decline in the total content of
cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of
damped Lyman-alpha systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of
supermassive black holes, quasars and starbursts is inextricably linked to the
hierarchical build-up of galaxies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9906493v1
"If the dark matter in galactic halos is made up of compact, macroscopic
objects (MO), such as black holes with $M_\MO >>M_{stars}$, gravitational
scattering will lead to kinematic heating of the stars. Observational
constraints on the amount of heating in the disk of the Milky Way put upper
limits on $M_\MO \ltorder 10^{6.3}\msun $. We find limits that are three orders
of magnitude more stringent by examining the heating limits in low mass stellar
systems, where higher densities of dark matter and lower relative velocities
disperse the stars in less than a billion years. Specifically, the structure
and kinematics of the Local Group member GR8 yield a limit of $M_\MO \ltorder
6\times 10^{3}\msun$. If the properties of the dark matter are universal these
results preclude the dominance of dark matter constituents in the
cosmologically interesting mass range $\sim 10^6\msun$ and limit them to $M_\MO
\ltorder 10^{3.7}\msun$. These results also rule out massive compact halo
objects as significant contributors to the kinematic heating of the Galactic
disk.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9308022v1
"Dark matter in the Universe consisting of macroscopic objects such as
primordial black holes may cause gravitational lensing of distant objects. The
magnification associated with lensing will lead to additional scatter in the
received flux from standard candles, and too small an observed scatter could
rule out compact dark matter entirely. In this letter, we show how the scatter
in fluxes of distant Type 1a supernovae could be used to distinguish between
models with and without lensing by macroscopic dark matter. The proposed SNAP
project, with $\sim 2400$ supernovae in the range $0.1\ls z\ls 1.7$, should be
able to identify models at 99.9% confidence, if systematic errors are
controlled. Note that this test is independent of any evolution of the mean
supernova luminosity with redshift. The variances of the current Supernova
Cosmology Project sample do not rule out compact lenses as dark matter:
formally they favour such a population, but the significance is low, and
removal of a single faint supernova from the sample reverses the conclusion.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104221v2
"The possibility that the masses of supermassive black holes (SBHs) correlate
with the total gravitational mass of their host galaxy, or the mass of the dark
matter halo in which they presumably formed, is investigated using a sample of
16 spiral and 20 elliptical galaxies. The bulge velocity dispersion, typically
defined within an aperture of size less than 0.5 kpc, is found to correlate
tightly with the galaxy's circular velocity, the latter measured at distances
from the galactic center at which the rotation curve is flat, 20 to 80kpc. By
using the well known M-sigma relation for SBHs, and a prescription to relate
the circular velocity to the mass of the dark matter halo in a standard CDM
cosmology, the correlation between velocity dispersion and circular velocity is
equivalent to one between SBH and halo masses. Such a correlation is found to
be nonlinear, with the ratio between the two masses decreasing from 2X10^-4 for
halos of 10^14 solar masses, to 10^-5 for halos of 10^12 solar masses.
Preliminary evidence suggests that halos smaller than ~5X10^11 solar masses are
increasingly less efficient -- perhaps unable -- at forming SBHs.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203469v2
"The astrophysical processes that led to the formation of the first seed black
holes and to their growth into the supermassive variety that powers bright
quasars at redshift 6 are poorly understood. In standard LCDM hierarchical
cosmologies, the earliest massive holes (MBHs) likely formed at redshift z~15
at the centers of low-mass (M>5e5 solar masses) dark matter ``minihalos'', and
produced hard radiation by accretion. FUV/X-ray photons from such
``miniquasars'' may have permeated the universe more uniformly than EUV
radiation, reduced gas clumping, and changed the chemistry of primordial gas.
The role of accreting seed black holes in determining the thermal and
ionization state of the intergalactic medium depends on the amount of cold and
dense gas that forms and gets retained in protogalaxies after the formation of
the first stars. The highest resolution N-body simulation to date of Galactic
substructure shows that subhalos below the atomic cooling mass were very
inefficient at forming stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701394v1
"We show that the luminosity function of the actively star-forming Lyman break
galaxies and the B-band quasar luminosity function at $z = 3$ can be fit
reasonably well with the mass function of collapsed galaxy scale dark matter
haloes predicted by viable variants of hierarchical cold dark matter dominated
cosmological models for lifetimes $t_Q$ of the optically bright phase of QSOs
in the range $10^{6}$ to $10^{8}$ yr. There is a strong correlation between
$t_Q$ and the required degree of non-linearity in the relation between black
hole and host halo mass. Such a non-linear relation is motivated by suggesting
that the mass of supermassive black holes may be limited by the back-reaction
of the emitted energy on the accretion flow in a self-gravitating disc. This
would imply a relation of black hole to halo mass of the form $M_{\rm bh}
\propto v_{\rm halo}^5 \propto M_{\rm halo}^{5/3}$ and a typical duration of
the optically bright QSO phase of the order of the Salpeter time, $\sim 10^{7}$
yr. The high integrated local mass density of black holes inferred from recent
kinematic determinations of black hole masses in nearby galaxies seem to
indicate that the overall efficiency of supermassive black holes for producing
blue light is lower than was previously assumed. We discuss three possible
accretion modes with low optical emission efficiency: (i) accretion well above
the Eddington rate, (ii) accretion obscured by dust, and (iii) accretion below
the critical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for
a Hubble time. We further argue that accretion with low optical efficiency
might be closely related to the origin of the hard X-ray background.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9809250v1
"(abridged) The observed properties of supermassive black holes suggest a
fundamental link between their assembly and the formation of their host
spheroids. We model the growth and activity of black holes in galaxies using
LambdaCDM cosmological hydrodynamic simulations by following the evolution of
the baryonic mass component in galaxy potential wells. We find that the
observed steep relation between black hole mass and spheroid velocity
dispersion, M_BH propto \sigma^4, is reproduced if the gas mass in bulges is
linearly proportional to the black hole mass. In this model, black hole growth
saturates because of the competition with star-formation and feedback, both of
which determine the gas fraction available for accretion. Unless other
processes also operate, we predict that the M_BH-sigma$ relation is not set in
primordial structures but is fully established at low redshifts, $z \approxlt
2$, and is shallower at earlier times. We find that that central black hole
masses are related to their dark matter halos simply via M_BH ~ M_DM^4/3. We
assume that galaxies undergo a quasar phase with a typical lifetime, t_Q ~
2\times 10^7 yr and show that star-formation regulated depletion of gas in
spheroids can explain the decrease of the quasar population at redshift z<3 in
the optical blue band. However, with the simplest assumption of a redshift
independent quasar lifetime, the model overpredicts optical quasar numbers at
high redshifts although it yields the observed evolution of number density of
X-ray quasars over the redshift range 1 < z< 6. Finally, we find that the
majority of black hole mass is assembled in galaxies by z ~ 3 and that the
black hole accretion rate density peaks in rough correspondence to the star
formation rate density at z ~ 4-5.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301586v2
"Recently it has been suggested that the majority of dark matter in the
universe resides in the form of Jupiter mass black holes distributed
cosmologically. This population makes itself apparent by microlensing high
redshift quasars and introducing pronounced variability into their observed
light curves. While several arguments dismissing this hypothesis have been
presented, a conclusive observational test is, alas, sadly lacking. In this
paper we investigate the effect of a cosmologically distributed population of
microlensing masses on galaxies at low to intermediate redshift. The
magnification of bright stars in these galaxies leads to small, but observable,
fluctuations in their surface brightness. The variability time scale for
Jupiter-mass lensing objects is of the order of a few months and this
population may be detected through a future space-based monitoring campaign of
a field containing $z \sim 0.5$ galaxies. The monitoring of galactic surface
brightness will provide an effective test of the nature of dark matter on
cosmological scales.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0004037v1
"Progress in observational cosmology over the past five years has established
that the Universe is dominated dynamically by dark matter and dark energy. Both
these new and apparently independent forms of matter-energy have properties
that are inconsistent with anything in the existing standard model of particle
physics, and it appears that the latter must be extended. We review what is
known about dark matter and energy from their impact on the light of the night
sky. Most of the candidates that have been proposed so far are not perfectly
black, but decay into or otherwise interact with photons in characteristic ways
that can be accurately modelled and compared with observational data. We show
how experimental limits on the intensity of cosmic background radiation in the
microwave, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma-ray bands put strong
limits on decaying vacuum energy, light axions, neutrinos, unstable
weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and objects like black holes. Our
conclusion is that the dark matter is most likely to be WIMPs if conventional
cosmology holds; or higher-dimensional sources if spacetime needs to be
extended.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407207v1
"Ultra-light scalar fields provide an interesting alternative to WIMPS as halo
dark matter. In this paper we consider the effect of embedding a supermassive
black hole within such a halo, and estimate the absorption probability and the
accretion rate of dark matter onto the black hole. We show that the accretion
rate would be small over the lifetime of a typical halo, and hence that
supermassive central black holes can coexist with scalar field halos.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207493v2
"We use semi-analytic modeling on top of the Millennium simulation to study
the joint formation of galaxies and their embedded supermassive black holes.
  Our goal is to test scenarios in which black hole accretion and quasar
activity are triggered by galaxy mergers, and to constrain different models for
the lightcurves associated with individual quasar events. In the present work
we focus on studying the spatial distribution of simulated quasars. At all
luminosities, we find that the simulated quasar two-point correlation function
is fit well by a single power-law in the range 0.5 < r < 20 h^{-1} Mpc, but its
normalization is a strong function of redshift. When we select only quasars
with luminosities within the range typically accessible by today's quasar
surveys, their clustering strength depends only weakly on luminosity, in
agreement with observations. This holds independently of the assumed lightcurve
model, since bright quasars are black holes accreting close to the Eddington
limit, and are hosted by dark matter haloes with a narrow mass range of a few
10^12 h^{-1} M_sun. Therefore the clustering of bright quasars cannot be used
to disentangle lightcurve models, but such a discrimination would become
possible if the observational samples can be pushed to significantly fainter
limits.
  Overall, our clustering results for the simulated quasar population agree
rather well with observations, lending support to the conjecture that galaxy
mergers could be the main physical process responsible for triggering black
hole accretion and quasar activity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0003v2
"Aims: We investigate the cosmological growth of dark halos and follow the
consequences of coeval growth for the accretion history of associated
supermassive black holes. Methods: The Press-Schechter approximation is used to
obtain an analytic expression for the mean rate of growth of dark matter halos.
Dark halo accretion rates are compared with numerical work and the consequences
for understanding AGN evolution are described. Results: The mean accretion rate
onto dark matter halos is shown to have a simple analytic form that agrees with
previous numerical work and that may easily be calculated for a wide range of
halo mass, redshift and cosmological parameters. The result offers a
significant improvement over published fitting formulae deduced from merger
trees. We then consider the growth of associated supermassive black holes, and
make a basic test of the simple hypothesis of `Pure Coeval Evolution' (PCE) in
which, on average, black hole growth tracks dark halo growth. We demonstrate
that both the absolute value of the integrated AGN bolometric luminosity
density and its cosmological evolution derived from hard X-ray surveys are
well-reproduced by PCE. Excellent agreement is found at z >~ 0.5, although the
observed luminosity density drops by a factor 2 compared with PCE by z=0: black
hole growth appears to decouple from halo growth at low redshifts, and this may
be related to the phenomenon of `cosmic downsizing'. Overall, AGN evolution
appears either to be caused by or to be closely linked to the slow-down in the
growth of cosmic structure. We also discuss the mean Eddington ratio averaged
over all galaxies, which is predicted to show strong evolution to higher values
with redshift.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608202v2
"Massive black hole binaries, with masses in the range 1E3-1E8 Msun, are

Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We extend and refine our previous analysis
(Sesana et al. 2004), detailing the gravitational wave signal expected from a
cosmological population of massive black hole binaries. As done in our previous
paper, we follow the merger history of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the
massive black holes they host, and their growth via gas accretion and binary
coalescences in a LCDM cosmology. Stellar dynamical processes dominates the
orbital evolution of black hole binaries at large separations, while
gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii, causing the final
coalescence of the pairs. We show that the GW signal from this population, in a
3 year LISA observation, will be resolved into approx 90 discrete events with
S/N>5, among which approx. 35 will be observed above threshold until
coalescence. These ""merging events"" involve relatively massive binaries, M=10E5
Msun, in the redshift range 2<z<6. The remaining approx. 55 events come from
higher redshift, less massive binaries (M=5E3 Msun at z>6) and, although their
S/N integrated over the duration of the observation can be substantial, the
final coalescence phase is at too high frequency to be directly observable by
space-based interferometers such as LISA. LISA will be able to detect a
fraction approx. 90% of all the coalescences of massive black hole binaries
occurring at z=5. The residual confusion noise from unresolved massive black
hole binaries is expected to be at least an order of magnitude below the
estimated stochastic noise.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409255v2
"A new scenario for the emission of high-energy gamma-rays from dark matter
annihilation around massive black holes is presented. A black hole can leave
its parent halo, by means of gravitational radiation recoil, in a merger event
or in the asymmetric collapse of its progenitor star. A recoiled black hole
which moves on an almost-radial orbit outside the virial radius of its central
halo, in the cold dark matter background, reaches its apapsis in a finite time.
Near or at the apapsis passage, a high-density wake extending over a large
radius of influence, forms around the black hole. It is shown that significant
gamma-ray emission can result from the enhancement of neutralino annihilation
in these wakes. At its apapsis passage, a black hole is shown to produce a
flash of high-energy gamma-rays whose duration is determined by the mass of the
black hole and the redshift at which it is ejected. The ensemble of such black
holes in the Hubble volume is shown to produce a diffuse high-energy gamma-ray
background whose magnitude is compared to the diffuse emission from dark matter
haloes alone.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3321v4
"If massive black holes constitute the dark matter in the halo surrounding the
Milky Way, the existence of low mass globular clusters in the halo suggests an
upper limit to their mass, $M_{_{BH}}$. We use a combination of the impulse
approximation and numerical simulations to constrain $M_{_{BH}} \lsim
10^3M_\odot$, otherwise several of the halo globular clusters would be heated
to disruption within one half of their lifetime. Taken at face value, this
constraint is three orders of magnitude stronger than the previous limit
provided by disk heating arguments. However, since the initial mass function of
clusters is unknown, we argue that the real constraint is at most, an order of
magnitude weaker. Our results rule out cosmological scenarios, such as versions
of the Primordial Baryonic Isocurvature fluctuation model, which invoke the low
Jeans mass at early epochs to create a large population of black holes of mass
$\sim 10^6M_\odot$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9306004v1

produced by the annihilation of dark matter particles in cosmological halos,
with particular attention to the consequences of the formation of supermassive
black holes. In scenarios where these objects form adiabatically from the
accretion of matter on small seeds, dark matter is first compressed into very
dense ``spikes'', then its density progressively decreases due to annihilations
and scattering off of stellar cusps. With respect to previous analyses, based
on non-evolving halos, the predicted annihilation signal is higher and
significantly distorted at low energies, reflecting the large contribution to
the total flux from unevolved spikes at high redshifts. The peculiar spectral
feature arising from the specific redshift distribution of the signal, would
discriminate the proposed scenario from more conventional astrophysical
explanations. We discuss how this affects the prospects for detection and
demonstrate that the gamma-ray background from DM annihilations might be
detectable even in absence of a signal from the Galactic center.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0703236v2
"Minor mergers of galaxies are expected to be common in a hierarchical
cosmology such as $\Lambda$CDM and have the potential to significantly affect
galactic structure. In this paper we dissect the case-by-case outcome from a
set of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accreting
onto a massive elliptical galaxy. We take care to explore cosmologically
relevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models that
include all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter halos, stellar
bulges, and central massive black holes. The effects of several different
parameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum,
satellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, and
presence of a black hole at the center of the host. Black holes play a crucial
role in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellites
merging onto a host with a central black hole are more strongly disrupted than
those merging onto hosts without black holes. Orbital parameters play an
important role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on less
bound or more eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on more
bound or more circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentric
passages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidal
stripping. In addition, satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical
galaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survive
much better in the tidal field of the host. Over the range of parameters
explored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy
can result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surface
brightness profile and color of the central part of an elliptical galaxy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608122v2

modified flux of dark matter particles onto the black hole is calculated.
Estimates of the amount of dark matter absorbed show that the fraction of dark

objects that collapse out of a Gaussian random field of initial density
perturbations. The population of low-spin systems is significant for any viable
power spectrum of primordial density perturbations. Most objects form just
above the cosmological Jeans mass (\sim 10^5 M_sun) at high redshifts z>10. In

"(Abridged) We use high resolution cosmological N-body simulations to study
the growth of intermediate to supermassive black holes from redshift 49 to
zero. We track the growth of black holes from the seeds of population III stars
to black holes in the range of 10^3 < M < 10^7 Msun -- not quasars, but rather
IMBH to low-mass SMBHs. These lower mass black holes are the primary observable
for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The large-scale dynamics of
the black holes are followed accurately within the simulation down to scales of
1 kpc; thereafter, we follow the merger analytically from the last dynamical
friction phase to black hole coalescence. We find that the merger rate of these
black holes is R~25 per year between 8 < z < 11 and R = 10 per year at z=3.
Before the merger occurs the incoming IMBH may be observed with a next
generation of X-ray telescopes as a ULX source with a rate of about ~ 3 - 7 per
year for 1 < z < 5. We develop an analytic prescription that captures the most
important black hole growth mechanisms: galaxy merger-driven gas accretion and
black hole coalescence. Using this, we find that SMBH at the center of Milky
Way type galaxy was in place with most of its mass by z = 4.7, and most of the
growth was driven by gas accretion excited by major mergers. Hundreds of black
holes have failed to coalesce with the SMBH by z=0, some with masses of 10000

"This paper presents a study of quasi-steady spherical accretion in the early
Universe, before the formation of the first stars and galaxies. The main
motivation is to derive the basic formulas that will be used in a companion
paper to calculate the accretion luminosity of primordial black holes and their
effect on the cosmic ionization history.
  The following cosmological effects are investigated: the coupling of the gas
to the CMB photon fluid (i.e., Compton drag), Hubble expansion, and the growth
of the dark matter halo seeded by the gravitational potential of the central
point mass. The gas equations of motion are solved assuming either a polytropic
or an isothermal equation of state. We consider the cases in which the
accreting object is a point mass or a spherical dark matter halo with power-law
density profile, as predicted by the theory of ""secondary infall''. Analytical
solutions for the sonic radius and fitting formulas for the accretion rate are
provided.
  Different accretion regimes exist depending on the mass of the accreting
object. If the black hole mass is smaller than 50-100 Msun, gas accretion is
unaffected by Compton drag. A point mass and an extended dark halo of equal
mass accrete at the same rate if M>5000 Msun, while smaller mass dark halos
accrete less efficiently than the equivalent point mass. For masses M>3 x 10^4
Msun, the viscous term due to the Hubble expansion becomes important and the
assumption of quasi-steady flow fails. Hence, the steady Bondi solutions
transition to the time-dependent self-similar solutions for ""cold cosmological

ionization conditions and in systems with or without non-baryonic components,
the baryons lose angular momentum efficiently and collapse to form a compact
optically--thick object which would probably quickly evolve into a massive

"We reconsider the possibility that the observed baryon asymmetry was
generated by the evaporation of primordial black holes that dominated the early
universe. We present a simple derivation showing that the baryon asymmetry is
insensitive to the initial black hole density and the cosmological model but is
sensitive to the temperature-dependence of the CP and baryon-violating (or
lepton-violating) interactions. We also consider the possibility that black
holes stop evaporating and form Planck-mass remnants that act as dark matter.
We show that primordial black holes cannot simultaneously account for both the
observed baryon asymmetry and the (remnant) dark matter density unless the
magnitude of CP violation is much greater than expected from most particle
physics models. Finally, we apply these results to ekpyrotic/cyclic models, in
which primordial black holes may form when branes collide. We find that
obtaining the observed baryon asymmetry is compatible with the other known
constraints on parameters.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0703250v1
"We investigate a hierarchical structure formation scenario in which galaxy
stellar cores are created from the binding energy liberated by shrinking

surrounding stars, eroding a preexisting 1/r^2 stellar cusp. We follow the
merger history of dark matter halos and associated SMBHs via cosmological Monte
Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present in a
LCDM cosmology. Massive black holes get incorporated through a series of
mergers into larger and larger halos, sink to the center owing to dynamical
friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become
supermassive, and form a binary system. Stellar dynamical processes drive the
binary to harden and eventually coalesce. A simple scheme is applied in which
the loss cone is constantly refilled and a constant density core forms due to
the ejection of stellar mass. We find that a model in which the effect of the
hierarchy of SMBH interactions is cumulative and cores are preserved during
galaxy mergers produces at the present epoch a correlation between the `mass
deficit' (the mass needed to bring a flat inner density profile to a 1/r^2
cusp) and the mass of the nuclear SMBH, with a normalization and slope
comparable to the observed relation. Models in which the mass displaced by the

the reionisation history of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use cosmological
simulations that include self-consistently the feedback from ionising

that it is difficult to reionise the IGM at z_rei>10 with stellar sources even
after making extreme assumptions. If star formation in 10^9 M_\odot galaxies is
not suppressed by SN explosions, the optical depth to Thomson scattering is
tau_e< 0.13. If we allow for the normal energy input from SNe or if
pair-instability SNe are dominant, we find taue<0.09. Assuming normal yields
for the first stars (popIII), the mean metallicity of the IGM is already
Z/Z_\odot=2x10^-3 (10^-3<Z/Z_\odot<1 in overdense regions) when the IGM mean
ionisation fraction is less than 10%. For these reasons popIII stars cannot
contribute significantly to reionisation unless the mechanical energy input
from SNe is greatly reduced and either the metal yield or the mixing efficiency
is reduced by a factor of 1000. Both problems have a solution if popIII stars
collapse to black holes. This can happen if, having masses M_*< 130 M_\odot,
they are characterised by heavy element fall-back or if, having masses M_*>260
M_\odot, they collapse directly onto black holes without exploding as SNe.If
metal-poor stars are initially important and collapse to black holes is the
typical outcome, then the secondary emission of ionising radiation from
accretion on SN induced seed black holes, might be more important than the
primary emission. Surprisingly, including feedback effects, we estimate that a
warm dark matter scenario (with particle mass of 1.25 keV) reduces tau_e by

form in ~ 10^{6} M_sun dark matter potential wells at redshifts z > 20. I
discuss the physical processes that govern the formation of the first stars.
These so-called Population~III stars are predicted to be predominantly very
massive, and to have contributed significantly to the early reionization of the
intergalactic medium. Such an early reionization epoch is inferred from the
recent measurement of the Thomson optical depth by the {\it WMAP} satellite. I
address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from
an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars, to the familiar mode
dominated by low mass stars, at later times, and present possible observational
probes. This transition could have been gradual, giving rise to an
intermediate-mass population of still virtually metal-free stars (``Population
II.5''). These stars could have given rise to the peculiar class of black-hole
forming supernovae inferred from the abundance pattern of extremely iron-poor
stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0509354v1
"In Figure 6 we inadvertently labeled the proxy circular velocity as the
virial velocity of the dark matter halo instead of what is actually plotted,
the maximum circular velocity of the dark matter halo. The maximum halo
circular velocity is a much better estimate of the disk V_c than is V_vir. This
confusion influenced the discussion of the Tully-Fisher relation in our paper.
In fact, Figure 6 demonstrates that it is possible to simultaneously reproduce
both the local Tully-Fisher relation and luminosity function using
semi-analytic techniques applied to the standard LCDM cosmology, thus
contradicting previous studies of this issue and our own discussion in Section
3.6.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602065v1
"Galaxies are complex systems the evolution of which apparently results from
the interplay of dynamics, star formation, chemical enrichment, and feedback
from supernova explosions and supermassive black holes. The hierarchical theory
of galaxy formation holds that galaxies are assembled from smaller pieces,
through numerous mergers of cold dark matter. The properties of an individual
galaxy should be controlled by six independent parameters including mass,
angular-momentum, baryon-fraction, age and size, as well as by the accidents of
its recent haphazard merger history. Here we report that a sample of galaxies
that were first detected through their neutral hydrogen radio-frequency
emission, and are thus free of optical selection effects, shows five
independent correlations among six independent observables, despite having a
wide range of properties. This implies that the structure of these galaxies
must be controlled by a single parameter, although we cannot identify this
parameter from our dataset. Such a degree of organisation appears to be at odds
with hierarchical galaxy formation, a central tenet of the cold dark matter
paradigm in cosmology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1554v1
"There have been proposals that primordial black hole remnants (BHRs) are the
dark matter, but the idea is somewhat vague. Recently we argued that the
generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) may prevent black holes from
evaporating completely, in a similar way that the standard uncertainty
principle prevents the hydrogen atom from collapsing. We further noted that the
hybrid inflation model provides a plausible mechanism for production of large
numbers of small black holes. Combining these we suggested that the dark matter
might be composed of Planck-size BHRs. In this paper we briefly review these
arguments, and discuss the reheating temperature as a result of black hole
evaporation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0305025v1
"The connection between dark matter and giant black holes in the galactic
nuclei is investigated. The joint evolution of dark and luminous matter in
averaged self-consistent gravitational potential is considered. It is shown
that the distribution of dark matter remains spherically symmetric even in
presence of essential asymmetry of luminous matter in the galaxy.
  The kinetic equation describing evolution of dark matter particles
distribution function which takes into account their dynamics in gravitational
potential and scattering on stars is derived. It is shown that significant flux
of dark matter on a seed black hole in the center of galaxy should appear. The
growth law of seed black hole due to absorption of dark matter is derived. It
appears that during the lifetime of galaxy the seed black hole should grow
significantly, up to observed value. Brief analysis of observational data shows
that the presented theory is in reasonable agreement with observations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0306490v2

gravitational field of black holes. We obtain exact distribution function of
the infalling dark matter particles, and compute the resulting flux and spectra

very high affecting relative cross-sections of various annihilation channels.
We also discuss possible experimental consequences of these effects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0124v2
"A review of the present observational and theoretical status of elliptical
galaxies is presented with the aim to clarify whether the monolithic or the
hierarchical, is a more viable scenario for the origin of these structures. We
describe the dynamical structure of elliptical galaxies using photometric and
spectroscopic data, in particular 3D observations from integral field
spectrographs, with emphasis on properties such as brightness distribution,
velocity profiles, central structures like ""cuspy"" profiles and ""cores"", as
well as central supermassive black holes.
  We also report on the main relations between these quantities like the
fundamental plane and colour-luminosity diagram. We present observational
evidences for the presence of dark matter in the elliptical galaxies and
examine the theories of galaxy formation within the framework of a cold dark
matter cosmological model. We discuss the formation of large-scale structure,
Press-Schechter theory and universal density profile of dark matter halos.
Subsequently, gas dynamics, star formation, feedback, angular momentum,
morphology and the epoch of galaxy formation are studied and comparison between
disks and spheroids are made. Valuable insights into the formation epoch of
elliptical galaxies are provided by deriving the mean metallicities and ages at
different redshifts through the study of different population synthesis models
(single-burst and evolutionary models) in particular the magnesium to iron
ratio.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301248v1
"We have used the hydrodynamical AMR code ENZO to investigate the dynamical
evolution of the gas at the centre of dark matter haloes with virial velocities
of ~ 20 - 30 kms and virial temperatures of ~ 13000-30000 K at z ~ 15 in a
cosmological context. The virial temperature of the dark matter haloes is above
the threshold where atomic cooling by hydrogen allows the gas to cool and
collapse. We neglect cooling by molecular hydrogen and metals, as may be
plausible if H_2 cooling is suppressed by a meta-galactic Lyman-Werner
background or an internal source of Lyman-Werner photons, and metal enrichment
has not progressed very far. The gas in the haloes becomes gravitationally
unstable and develops turbulent velocities comparable to the virial velocities
of the dark matter haloes. Within a few dynamical times it settles into a
nearly isothermal density profile over many decades in radius losing most of
its angular momentum in the process. About 0.1 - 1 % of the baryons, at the
centre of the dark matter haloes, collapse into a self-gravitating, fat,
ellipsoidal, centrifugally supported exponential disc with scale-length of ~
0.075-0.27 pc and rotation velocities of 25-60 kms. We are able to follow the
settling of the gas into centrifugal support and the dynamical evolution of the
compact disc in each dark matter halo for a few dynamical times. The dynamical
evolution of the gas at the centre of the haloes is complex. In one of the
haloes the gas at the centre fragments into a triple system leading to strong
tidal perturbations and eventually to the in-fall of a secondary smaller clump
into the most massive primary clump. The formation of centrifugally supported
self-gravitating massive discs is likely to be an important intermediary stage
en route to the formation of a massive black hole seed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0024v1
"(Abridged) This is the second of two companion papers on the interior
structure of self-similar accreting charged black holes. In the first paper,
the black hole was allowed to accrete only a single fluid of charged baryons.
In this second paper, the black hole is allowed to accrete in addition a
neutral fluid of almost non-interacting dark matter. Relativistic streaming
between outgoing baryons and ingoing dark matter leads to mass inflation near
the inner horizon. When enough dark matter has been accreted that the center of
mass frame near the inner horizon is ingoing, then mass inflation ceases and
the fluid collapses to a central singularity. A null singularity does not form
on the Cauchy horizon. Although the simultaneous presence of ingoing and
outgoing fluids near the inner horizon is essential to mass inflation, reducing
one or other of the ingoing dark matter or outgoing baryonic streams to a trace
relative to the other stream makes mass inflation more extreme, not the other
way round as one might naively have expected. Consequently, if the dark matter
has a finite cross-section for being absorbed into the baryonic fluid, then the
reduction of the amount of ingoing dark matter merely makes inflation more
extreme, the interior mass exponentiating more rapidly and to a larger value
before mass inflation ceases. However, if the dark matter absorption
cross-section is effectively infinite at high collision energy, so that the
ingoing dark matter stream disappears completely, then the outgoing baryonic
fluid can drop through the Cauchy horizon. In all cases, the solutions do not
depend on what happens in the infinite past or future. We discuss in some
detail the physical mechanism that drives mass inflation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0411062v2
"We study the gas metallicity of quasar hosts using cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations of the Lambda-cold dark matter model. Galaxy formation in the
simulations is coupled with a prescription for black hole activity enabling us
to study the evolution of the metal enrichment in quasar hosts and hence
explore the relationship between star/spheroid formation and black hole
growth/activity. We find a steep radial metallicity gradient in quasar host
galaxies, with gas metallicities close to solar values in the outer parts but
becoming supersolar in the center. The hosts of the rare bright quasars at
z~5-6 have star formation rates of several hundred solar masses per year and
halo masses of order ~10^12 solar masses. Already at these redshifts they have
supersolar (Z ~2-3 solar) central metallicities, with a mild dependence of
metallicity on luminosity, consistent with observed trends. The mean value of
metallicity is sensitive to the assumed quasar lifetime, providing a useful new
probe of this parameter. We find that lifetimes from 10^7-4x10^7yr are favored
by comparison to observational data. In both the models and observations, the
rate of evolution of the mean quasar metallicity as a function of redshift is
generally flat out to z ~ 4-5. Beyond the observed redshift range and out to
redshift z ~ 6-8, we predict a slow decline of the mean central metallicity
towards solar and slightly subsolar values as we approach the epoch of the
first significant star formation activity",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0309533v2
"A central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a mass $10^6-10^9 M_\odot$
appears to be a common feature in nearby galaxies and the likely power source
in quasars and active galactic nuclei. We demonstrate that the formation of a
central black hole is a natural and inevitable consequence of the gravothermal
catastrophe in a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halo. Through gravothermal
evolution driven by collisional relaxation, an SIDM halo will form a massive
inner core whose density and velocity dispersion will increase secularly in
time. Eventually, the inner core arrives at a relativistic radial instability
and undergoes dynamical collapse to a black hole. The initial mass of the black
hole will be $10^{-8}-10^{-6}$ of the total mass of the halo. We show that if
at formation the overdensity in the SIDM halo is not too large, SMBHs in the
observed mass range can form directly in very massive halos following core
collapse. Alternatively, with large overdensities, moderate mass halos undergo
core collapse to form central seed black holes of intermediate mass, and these
holes can then merge and/or accrete to reach the SMBH range. Forming SMBHs by
core collapse in SIDM halos requires no baryons, no prior epoch of star
formation and no other mechanism of forming black holes seeds.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0111176v3
"We simulate the ionization environment of z ~ 20 luminous objects formed
within the framework of the current CDM cosmology and compute their UV escape
fraction. These objects are likely single very massive stars that are copious
UV emitters. We present analytical estimates as well as one--dimensional
radiation hydrodynamical calculations of the evolution of these first HII
regions in the universe. The initially D--type ionization front evolves to
become R--type within $\lesssim 10^5$ yrs at a distance $\sim1$ pc. This
ionization front then completely overruns the halo, accelerating an expanding
shell of gas outward to velocities in excess of 30 km s$^{-1}$, about ten times
the escape velocity of the confining dark matter halo. We find that the
evolution of the HII region depends only weakly on the assumed stellar ionizing
luminosities. Consequently, most of the gas surrounding the first stars will
leave the dark halo whether or not the stars produce supernovae. If they form
the first massive seed black holes these are unlikely to accrete within a
Hubble time after they formed until they are incorporated into larger dark
matter halos that contain more gas. Because these I--fronts exit the halo on
timescales much shorter than the stars' main sequence lifetimes their host
halos have UV escape fractions of $\gtrsim 0.95$, fixing an important parameter
for theoretical studies of cosmological hydrogen reionization.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310283v2
"Model of supermassive black holes formation inside the clusters of primordial
black holes is developed. Namely, it is supposed, that some mass fraction of
the universe ~10^-3 is composed of the compact clusters of primordial (relic)
black holes, produced during phase transitions in the early universe. These
clusters are the centers of dark matter condensation. We model the formation of
protogalaxies with masses about 2*10^8M_sun at the redshift z=15. These induced
protogalaxies contain central black holes with mass ~10^5M_sun and look like
dwarf spheroidal galaxies with central density spike. The subsequent merging of
induced protogalaxies and ordinary dark matter haloes corresponds to the
standard hierarchical clustering scenario of large-scale structure formation.
The coalescence of primordial black holes results in formation of supermassive
black holes in the galactic centers. As a result, the observed correlation
between the masses of central black holes and velocity dispersion in the
galactic bulges is reproduced.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0885v1

"In cuspy atmospheres, jets driven by supermassive black holes (BHs) offset
radiative cooling. The jets fire episodically, but often enough that the cuspy
atmosphere does not move very far towards a cooling catastrophe in the
intervals of jet inactivity. The ability of energy released on the sub-parsec
scale of the BH to balance cooling on scales of several tens of kiloparsecs
arises through a combination of the temperature sensitivity of the accretion
rate and the way in which the radius of jet disruption varies with ambient
density. Accretion of hot gas does not significantly increase BH masses, which
are determined by periods of rapid BH growth and star formation when cold gas
is briefly abundant at the galactic centre. Hot gas does not accumulate in
shallow potential wells. As the Universe ages, deeper wells form, and
eventually hot gas accumulates. This gas soon prevents the formation of further
stars, since jets powered by the BH prevent it from cooling, and it mops up
most cold infalling gas before many stars can form. Thus BHs set the upper
limit to the masses of galaxies. The formation of low-mass galaxies is
inhibited by a combination of photo-heating and supernova-driven galactic
winds. Working in tandem these mechanisms can probably explain the profound
difference between the galaxy luminosity function and the mass function of dark
halos expected in the cold dark matter cosmology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407238v1
"The tight correlation between galaxy bulges and their central black hole
masses likely emerges in a phase of rapid collapse and starburst at high
redshift, due to the balance of gravity on gas with the feedback force from
starbursts and the wind from the black hole; the average gravity on per unit
mass of gas is ~ 2 x 10^-10 m/sec^2 during the star burst phase. This level of
gravity could come from the real r^{-1} cusps of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos,
but the predicted gravity would have a large scatter due to dependence on
cosmological parameters and formation histories. Better agreement is found with
the gravity from the scalar field in some co-variant versions of MOND, which
can create the mirage of a Newtonian effective dark halo of density Pi r^{-1}
near the center, where the characteristic surface density Pi=130alpha^{-1} Msun
pc^{-2} and alpha is a fundamental constant of order unity fixed by the
Lagrangian of the co-variant theory if neglecting environmental effects.
  We show with a toy analytical model and a hydrodynamical simulation that a
constant background gravity due to MOND/TeVeS scalar field implies a critical
pressure synchronizing starbursts and the formation of galaxy bulges and
ellipticals. A universal threshold for the formation of the brightest regions
of galaxies in a MONDian universe suggests that the central BHs, bulges and
ellipticals would respect tight correlations like the M_{bulge}-M_{BH}-sigma
relations. In general MOND tends to produce tight correlations in galaxy
properties because its effective halo has less freedom and scatter than CDM
halos.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1073v3

proven elusive to detect.Gravitational tunneling emission is similar to
electric field emission of electronsfrom a metal in that a second body is

"We study the cross-correlation between quasars and galaxies by embedding
models for the formation and evolution of the two populations in cosmological
N-body simulations. We adopt the quasar evolution model of Kauffmann & Haehnelt
(2000), in which supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during major
mergers. We define the `bias' parameter b_QG as the ratio of the
cross-correlation function xi_QG to the galaxy auto-correlation function xi_GG.
On scales larger than 1 h^{-1} Mpc, the values of b_QG predicted by our models
at low redshift depend very little on galaxy selection. They measure the
characteristic mass of the dark matter halos that host quasars and can be used
to estimate the typical quasar lifetime. In current redshift surveys, such
measurements will constrain the lifetimes of low z quasars more accurately than
measurements of the quasar auto-correlation function, because galaxies have
much higher space densities than quasars. On scales smaller than 1 h^{-1} Mpc,
the main contribution to xi_QG comes from quasar/galaxy pairs in the same dark
matter halo. The amplitude of xi_QG depends both on the location of the host
galaxy and on the density profile of other galaxies within the halo. As a
result, measurements on these scales yield information about the processes
responsible for fuelling super- massive black holes. At high redshifts, our
models predict that quasars of fixed luminosity are located in less massive
halos than at low redshift. They are therefore less biased relative to galaxies
of given luminosity or stellar mass. We have used the simulations to calculate
the evolution of the quasar auto- correlation function. We find that models
with quasar lifetimes in the range 10^6-10^7 years provide a good match to the
results of the 2dF QSO survey.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108275v1

on the cosmological abundance of intergalactic supermassive compact objects in
the mass range $\sim 10^{6}$ to $\sim 10^{8}$M$_{\odot}$; such objects cannot
make up more than $\sim 1%$ of the closure density (95% confidence). A
uniformly distributed population of supermassive black holes forming soon after

content of the Universe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0101328v1
"In popular cold dark matter cosmological scenarios, stars may have first
appeared in significant numbers around a redshift of 10 or so, as the gas
within protogalactic halos with virial temperatures in excess of 20,000 K

cooled rapidly due to atomic processes and fragmented. It is this `second
generation' of subgalactic stellar systems, aided perhaps by an early
population of accreting black holes in their nuclei, which may have generated
the ultraviolet radiation and mechanical energy that ended the cosmic ``dark
ages'' and reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the cosmos by a
redshift of 6. The detailed history of the universe during and soon after these
crucial formative stages depends on the power--spectrum of density fluctuations
on small scales and on a complex network of poorly understood `feedback'
mechanisms, and is one of the missing link in galaxy formation and evolution
studies. The astrophysics of the epoch of first light is recorded in the
thermal state, ionization degree, and chemical composition of the intergalactic

"The first luminous objects in the concordance cosmology form by molecular
hydrogen cooling in dark matter dominated halos of masses ~10^6 M_sun. We use
Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulations to demonstrate that in the
presence of a large soft ultraviolet radiation background, molecular hydrogen
is the dominant coolant. Even for very large radiation backgrounds, the halo
masses that cool and collapse are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than
the halos that cool via atomic hydrogen line cooling. The abundance of cooling
halos and the cosmic mass fraction contained within them depends exponentially
on this critical mass scale. Consequently, the majority of current models of
cosmological reionization, chemical evolution, supermassive black hole
formation, and galaxy formation underestimate the number of star forming
progenitors of a given system by orders of magnitude. At the highest redshifts,
this disagreement is largest. We also show that even in the absence of residual
electrons, collisional ionization in central shocks create a sufficient amount
of electrons to form molecular hydrogen and cool the gas in halos of virial
temperatures far below the atomic cooling limit.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.2059v2
"High resolution, deep imaging surveys are instrumental in setting constraints
on semi-analytical structure formation models in Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
cosmologies. We show here that the lack of unresolved B-band ``dropouts'' with
V > 25 mag in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) appears to be inconsistent with the
expected number of quasars if massive black holes form with a constant
universal efficiency in all CDM halos. To reconcile the models with the data, a
mechanism is needed that suppresses the formation of quasars in halos with
circular velocities v(circ) < 50-75 km/s. This feedback naturally arises due to
the photoionization heating of the gas by the UV background. We consider
several alternative effects that would help reduce the quasar number counts,
and find that these can not alone account for the observed lack of detections.
If reddening by dust can be neglected at early epochs, consistency with the
optical data also requires that the luminous extent of dwarf galaxies at high
redshifts be larger than a few percent of the virial radii of their dark matter
halos, in order not to overpredict the number of point-like B-band dropouts.

existing B, V, and I data.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805258v1
"Using the results of recent optical surveys we conclude that the {\it
non}-detection of quasars down to faint magnitudes implies a significant
flattening of the high redshift (z~6) optical active galactic nuclei (AGN)
luminosity function for M_{1450}>-24.7. We find that all the data are
consistent with a faint-end slope for the optical AGN luminosity function of
\beta=-2.2 and \beta=-2.8, at the 90% and 99% confidence level respectively,
flatter than the bright-end slope of \beta'~ -3.2. We also show that X-ray deep
surveys have probed even fainter magnitudes than the optical ones yielding more
significant constraints on the shallow faint-end slope of the optical
luminosity function. The inclusion of Type II AGN candidates, detected in the
Chandra deep fields, hints towards an higher normalization for the total AGN
luminosity function, if these sources lie at 5<z <6.5. We then discuss simple
theoretical models of AGN formation and evolution in the context of cold dark
matter cosmology. The comparison with the total AGN luminosity function favors
a redshift-dependent relation between black hole and dark matter halo masses of
the type M_BH~M_ halo^\alpha, with 1.3< \alpha< 1.7, compatible with
independent studies from statistical analysis and rotation curve measurements.

"We report on a calculation of the growth of the mass of supermassive black
holes at galactic centers from dark matter and Eddington - limited baryonic
accretion. Assuming that dark matter halos are made of fermions and harbor
compact degenerate Fermi balls of masses from $10^{3}M_{\odot}$ to
$10^{6}M_{\odot}$, we find that dark matter accretion can boost the mass of
seed black holes from about $\sim 5M_{\odot}$ to $10^{3-4}M_{\odot}$ black
holes, which then grow by Eddington - limited baryonic accretion to
supermassive black holes of $10^{6 - 9}M_{\odot}$. We then show that the
formation of the recently detected supermassive black hole of $3\times
10^{9}M_{\odot}$ at a redshift of $z = 6.41$ in the quasar SDSS
J114816.64+525150.3 could be understood if the black hole completely consumes
the degenerate Fermi ball and then grows by Eddington - limited baryonic
accretion. In the context of this model we constrain the dark matter particle
masses to be within the range from 12 ${\rm keV/c}^{2}$ to about 450 ${\rm
keV/c}^{2}$. Finally we investigate the black hole growth dependence on the
formation time of the seed BH and on the mass of the seed BH. We find that in
order to fit the observed data point of $M_{BH} \sim 3 \times 10^{9}M_{\odot}$
and $z \sim 6.41$, dark matter accretion cannot start later than about $2
\times 10^{8}$ years and the seed BH cannot be greater than about
$10^{4}M_{\odot}$. Our results are in full agreement with the WMAP observations

redshift of $z \sim 15 - 20$. For other models of dark matter particle masses,
corresponding constraints may be derived from the growth of black holes in the
center of galaxies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403511v3

"The transition between the nearly smooth initial state of the Universe and
its clumpy state today occurred during the epoch when the first stars and
low-luminosity quasars formed. For Cold Dark Matter cosmologies, the radiation
produced by the first baryonic objects is expected to ionize the Universe at
z=10-20 and consequently suppress by 10% the amplitude of microwave
anisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees. Future microwave anisotropy
satellites will be able to detect this signature. The production and mixing of
metals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the
metallicity, ~1% solar, found in the intergalactic medium at redshifts z<5. The
Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will be able to image directly the
``first light'' from these stars. With its nJy sensitivity, NGST is expected to
detect >10^3 star clusters per square arcminute at z>10. The brightest sources,
however, might be early quasars. The infrared flux from an Eddington
luminosity, 10^6 solar mass, black hole at z=10 is 10 nJy at 1 micron, easily
detectable with NGST. The time it takes a black hole with a radiative
efficiency of 10% to double its mass amounts to more than a tenth of the Hubble
time at z=10, and so a fair fraction of all systems which harbor a central
black hole at this redshift would appear active. The redshift of all sources
can be determined from the Lyman-limit break in their spectrum, which overlaps
with the NGST wavelength regime, 1-3.5 micron, for 10<z<35. Absorption spectra
of the first generation of star clusters or quasars would reveal the
reionization history of the Universe. The intergalactic medium might show a
significant opacity to infrared sources at z>10 due to dust produced by the
first supernovae.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9704290v1
"Although the population of luminous quasars rises and falls over a period of
10^9 years, the typical lifetime of individual quasars is uncertain by several
orders of magnitude. We show that quasar clustering measurements can
substantially narrow the range of possible lifetimes with the assumption that
luminous quasars reside in the most massive host halos. If quasars are
long-lived, then they are rare phenomena that are highly biased with respect to
the underlying dark matter, while if they are short-lived they reside in more
typical halos that are less strongly clustered. For a given quasar lifetime, we
calculate the minimum host halo mass by matching the observed space density of
quasars, using the Press-Schechter approximation. We use the results of Mo &
White to calculate the clustering of these halos, and hence of the quasars they
contain, as a function of quasar lifetime. A lifetime of t_Q = 4 x 10^7 years,
the e-folding timescale of an Eddington luminosity black hole with accretion
efficiency eps=0.1, corresponds to a quasar correlation length r_0 ~ 10 Mpc/h
in low-density cosmological models at z=2-3; this value is consistent with
current clustering measurements, but these have large uncertainties.
High-precision clustering measurements from the 2dF and Sloan quasar surveys
will test our key assumption of a tight correlation between quasar luminosity
and host halo mass, and if this assumption holds then they should determine t_Q
to a factor of three or better. An accurate determination of the quasar
lifetime will show whether supermassive black holes acquire most of their mass
during high-luminosity accretion, and it will show whether the black holes in
the nuclei of typical nearby galaxies were once the central engines of
high-luminosity quasars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0002384v2

LCDM cosmology, coupled to semi-analytical recipes, to follow the merger
history of dark matter halos, the dynamics of the MBHs they host, and their
growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences. The coalescence of comparable
mass holes increases the spin of MBHs, while the capture of smaller companions
in randomly-oriented orbits acts to spin holes down. We find that, given the
distribution of MBH binary mass ratios in hierarchical models, binary
coalescences alone do not lead to a systematic spin-up or spin-down of MBHs
with time: the spin distribution retains memory of its initial conditions. By
contrast, because of the Bardeen-Petterson effect, gas accretion via a thin
disk tends to spin holes up even if the direction of the spin axis changes
randomly in time. In our models, accretion dominates over black hole captures
and efficiently spins holes up. The spin distribution is heavily skewed towards
fast-rotating Kerr holes, is already in place at early epochs, and does not
change much below redshift 5. If accretion is via a thin disk, about 70% of all
MBHs are maximally rotating and have radiative efficiencies approaching 30%
(assuming a ""standard'' spin-efficiency conversion). Even in the conservative
case where accretion is via a geometrically thick disk, about 80% of all MBHs
have spin parameters a/m > 0.8 and accretion efficiencies > 12%. Rapidly
spinning holes with high radiative efficiencies may satisfy constraints based
on comparing the local MBH mass density with the mass density inferred from
luminous quasars (Soltan's argument).",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0410342v1
"Different studies show that dark matter of non-baryonic origin might exist.
There have been experimental evidences that at least one form of dark matter
has been detected through microlensing effects. This form of dark matter is
named MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects). The MACHO
collaboration estimated that the masses of these objects are to be in the range
0.15-0.95 solar masses, where the most probable mass is of 0.5 solar masses.
Some authors argue that MACHOs could be black holes, and that they could form
binary systems, BHMACHO binaries. As is well known binary systems are sources
of gravitational waves. The Brazilian spherical antenna will operate in the
frequency band of 3.0-3.4 kHz, sensitive to binaries of a pair of 0.5 solar
mass black holes just before coalescing. In the present work we study the
detectability of these putative BHMACHO binaries by the Brazilian spherical
antenna Mario Schenberg.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503109v1
"The high sensitivity of upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors
suggests the possibility that if halo dark matter were composed of primordial
black holes (PBHs) with mass between $10^{16}$ g and 10$^{20}$ g, the
gravitational interaction with detector test masses will lead to a detectable
pulse-like signal during the fly-by. For an improved version of the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna with a reduced acceleration noise at the low-end
of its frequency spectrum, we find an event rate, with signal-to-noise ratios
greater than 5, of $\sim$ a few per decade involving black holes of mass $\sim$
10$^{17}$ g. The detection rate improves significantly for second generation
space based interferometers that are currently envisioned, though these events
must be distinguished from those involving perturbations due to near-Earth
asteroids. While the presence of primordial black holes below a mass of $\sim$
10$^{16}$ g is now constrained based on the radiation released during their
evaporation, the gravitational wave detectors will extend the study of PBHs to
a several orders of magnitude higher masses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405216v1
"The processes are investigated by which gas loses its angular momentum during
the protogalactic collapse phase, leading to disk galaxies that are too compact
with respect to the observations. High-resolution N-body/SPH simulations in a
cosmological context are presented including cold gas and dark matter. A halo
with quiet merging activity since z~3.8 and with a high spin parameter is
analysed that should be an ideal candidate for the formation of an extended
galactic disk. We show that the gas and the dark matter have similar specific
angular momenta until a merger event occurs at z~2 with a mass ratio of 5:1.
All the gas involved in the merger loses a substantial fraction of its specific
angular momentum due to tidal torques and falls quickly into the center.
Dynamical friction plays a minor role,in contrast to previous claims. In fact,
after this event a new extended disk begins to form from gas that was not
involved in the 5:1 merger event and that falls in subsequently. We argue that
the angular momentum problem of disk galaxy formation is a merger problem: in
cold dark matter cosmology substantial mergers with mass ratios of 1:1 to 6:1
are expected to occur in almost all galaxies. We suggest that energetic
feedback processes could in principle solve this problem, however only if the
heating occurs at the time or shortly before the last substantial merger event.
Good candidates for such a coordinated feedback would be a merger-triggered
star burst or central black hole heating. If a large fraction of the low
angular momentum gas would be ejected as a result of these processes, late-type
galaxies could form with a dominant extended disk component, resulting from
late infall, a small bulge-to-disk ratio and a low baryon fraction, in
agreement with observations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602005v1
"We have used GADGET2 to simulate the formation of an elliptical galaxy in a
cosmological dark matter halo with mass 3x10^12M_Sun/h. Using a stellar
population synthesis model has allowed us to compute magnitudes, colours and
surface brightness profiles. We have included a model to follow the growth of a
central black hole and we have compared the results of simulations with and
without feedback from AGNs. We have studied the interplay between cold gas
accretion and merging in the development of galactic morphologies, the link
between colour and morphology evolution, the effect of AGN feedback on the
photometry of early type galaxies, the redshift evolution in the properties of
quasar hosts, and the impact of AGN winds on the chemical enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM). We have found that the early phases of galaxy
formation are driven by the accretion of cold filamentary flows, which form a
disc at the centre of the dark matter halo. When the dark matter halo is
sufficiently massive to support the propagation of a stable shock, cold
accretion is shut down, and the star formation rate begins to decline. Mergers
transform the disc into an elliptical galaxy, but also bring gas into the
galaxy. Without a mechanism that removes gas from the merger remnants, the
galaxy ends up with blue colours, atypical for its elliptical morphology. AGN
feedback can solve this problem even with a fairly low heating efficiency. We
have also demonstrated that AGN winds are potentially important for the metal
enrichment of the IGM a high redshift.(abridged)",http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3289v2

cooled rapidly due to atomic processes and fragmented. It is this `second
generation' of subgalactic stellar systems, aided perhaps by an early
population of accreting black holes in their nuclei, which may have generated
the ultraviolet radiation and mechanical energy that ended the cosmic ``dark
ages'' and reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the universe by a
redshift of 6. The detailed history of the universe during and soon after these
crucial formative stages depends on the power-spectrum of density fluctuations
on small scales and on a complex network of poorly understood `feedback'
mechanisms, and is one of the missing link in galaxy formation and evolution

scenarios are still consistent with the current data. In light of this we study
the impact that such models can have on the determination of several
cosmological parameters. In particular, the constraints on curvature and baryon
density appear to be weakly affected by a modified recombination scheme.
However, it may affect the current WMAP constraints on inflationary parameters
like the spectral index and its running. Physically motivated models, like

with properties quite distinct compared to ordinary black holes in
4-dimensions. We discuss certain key features of some braneworld black hole
geometries. Such black holes are likely to have diverse cosmological and
astrophysical ramifications. The cosmological evolution of primordial
braneworld black holes is described highlighting their longevity due to
modified evaporation and effective accretion of radiation during the early
braneworld high energy era. Observational abundance of various evaporation
products of the black holes at different eras impose constraints on their

"The existence of black holes remains open to doubt until other conceivable
options are excluded. With this motivation, we consider a model of a compact
star in which most of the mass consists of dark particles of some kind, and a
small fraction of the mass is in the form of ordinary nucleonic gas. The gas
does not interact with the dark matter other than via gravity, but collects at
the center as a separate fermionic fluid component. Depending on whether the
dark mass is made of fermions or bosons, the objects may be called
fermion-fermion stars or boson-fermion stars, respectively. For appropriate
choices of the mass of the dark matter particles, these objects are viable
models of black hole candidates in X-ray binaries. We consider models with a
dark mass of 10 solar masses and a range of gas mass from 10^{-6} to nearly one
solar mass, and analyse the bursting properties of the models when they accrete
gas. We show that all the models would experience thermonuclear Type I X-ray
bursts at appropriate mass accretion rates. Since no Type I bursts have been
reported from black hole candidates, the models are ruled out. The case for
identifying black hole candidates in X-ray binaries as true black holes is thus
strengthened.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401549v1
"The evolution of dark matter in central areas of galaxies is considered (the
Milky Way is taken as an example). It is driven by scattering off of dark
matter particles by bulge stars, their absorption by the supermassive black
hole and self-annihilation. This process is described by diffusion equation in
the phase space of energy and angular momentum. The equation was integrated for
several different models of initial dark matter distribution and using various
assumptions about the dynamical factors. It turns out that because the Milky
Way center is rather dynamically old (~5 relaxation times t_r), the difference
in initial conditions almost vanishes. The density attains a nearly universal
profile, and the gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation lies in rather
narrow range, which enables more robust determination of the dark matter
parameters. By present time the mass of dark matter inside the black hole
sphere of influence (r<2 pc) has been reduced approximately twice, mostly
because of heating by stars. It is shown that the dynamics of dark matter for
t>t_r is determined mainly by stars outside the sphere of influence.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0002v2
"I review the properties of degenerate fermion balls and investigate the dark

explain the galactic center black hole of mass of $\sim 3.5 \times

$0.6 {\rm keV}$ and $82 {\rm keV}$. The lower limit on the dark matter mass is
improved to about {\rm 6 keV} if exact solutions of Poisson's equation are used

"We discuss the possibilities for primordial black holes (PBHs) to grow via
the accretion of dark matter. In agreement with previous works, we find that
accretion during the radiation-dominated era does not lead to a significant
mass increase. However, during matter-domination, PBHs may grow by up to two
orders of magnitude in mass through the acquisition of large dark matter halos.
We discuss the possibility of PBHs being an important component in dark matter
halos of galaxies as well as their potential to explain the ultra-luminous
x-ray sources (ULXs) observed in nearby galactic disks. We point out that
although PBHs are ruled out as the dominant component of dark matter, there is
still a great deal of parameter space open to them playing a role in the
modern-day universe. For example, a primordial halo population of PBHs each at
$10^{2.5} M_\odot$ making up 0.1% of the dark matter grow to $10^{4.5} M_\odot$
via the accumulation of dark matter halos to account for $\sim 10%$ of the dark
matter mass by a redshift of $z \approx 30$. These intermediate mass black
holes may then ``light up'' when passing through molecular clouds, becoming
visible as ULXs at the present day, or they may form the seeds for supermassive
black holes at the centers of galaxies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608642v1
"(Abridged) The thermal state of the intracluster medium results from a
competition between gas cooling and heating. The heating comes from two
distinct sources: gravitational heating from the collapse of the dark matter
halo and thermal input from galaxy/black hole formation. However, a long
standing problem has been that cosmological simulations based on smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and Eulerian mesh codes predict different results
even when cooling and galaxy/black hole heating are switched off. Clusters
formed in SPH simulations show near powerlaw entropy profiles, while those
formed in mesh simulations develop a core and do not allow gas to reach such
low entropies. Since the cooling rate is closely connected to the minimum
entropy of the gas, the differences are of potentially key importance.
  In this paper, we investigate the origin of this discrepancy. By comparing
simulations run using the GADGET-2 SPH code and the FLASH adaptive Eulerian
mesh code, we show that the discrepancy arises during the idealised merger of
two clusters. The difference is not sensitive to the resolution of our
simulations, nor is it is due differences in the gravity solvers, Galilean
non-invariance of the mesh code, or an effect of unsuitable artificial
viscosity in the SPH code. Instead, we find that the difference is inherent to
the treatment of eddies and fluid instabilities. These are suppressed in the
SPH simulations, while the cluster mergers generate strong vortices in the mesh
simulations that efficiently mix the fluid and erase the low entropy gas.
Consequently, particles in the SPH simulations retain a close connection to
their initial entropy, while this connection is much weaker in the mesh
simulations. We discuss the potentially profound implications of these results.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1750v2

model is constructed using the Limiting Curvature Hypothesis (LCH) and in the
context of two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The black hole solution exhibits
properties of the standard Schwarzschild solution at large values of the radial
coordinate. However, near the center, the black hole is nonsingular and the
metric becomes that of de Sitter spacetime. The Hawking temperature is
calculated using the method of complex paths. We find that such black holes
radiate eternally and never completely evaporate. The final state is an
eternally radiating relic, near the fundamental scale, which should make a
viable dark matter candidate. We briefly comment on the black hole information
loss problem and the production of such black holes in collider experiments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0210016v4
"In the standard flat cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) cold dark matter (CDM)
cosmology, a model of two populations of lens halos for strong gravitational
lensing can reproduce the results of the Jodrell-Bank VLA Astrometric Survey
(JVAS) and the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) radio survey. In such a
model, lensing probabilities are sensitive to three parameters: the
concentration parameter $c_1$, the cooling mass scale $M_\mathrm{c}$ and the
value of the CDM power spectrum normalization parameter $\sigma_8$. The value
ranges of these parameters are constrained by various observations. However, we
found that predicted lensing probabilities are also quite sensitive to the flux
density (brightness) ratio $q_{\mathrm{r}}$ of the multiple lensing images,
which has been, in fact, a very important selection criterion of a sample in
any lensing survey experiments. We re-examine the above mentioned model by
considering the flux ratio and galactic central Super Massive Black Holes

equations of state $\omega$, and find that the predicted lensing probabilities
without considering $q_{\mathrm{r}}$ are over-estimated. A low value of

$M_\mathrm{c}$ in fitting the predicted lensing probabilities to JVAS/CLASS

uncertainty in $M_\mathrm{c}$ must be resolved. The effects of SMBHs cannot be

"We study the constraints that high-redshift structure formation in the
universe places on warm dark matter (WDM) dominated cosmological models. We
modify the extended Press-Schechter formalism to derive the halo mass function
in WDM models. We show that our predictions agree with recent numerical
simulations at low redshift over the halo masses of interest. Applying our
model to galaxy formation at high redshift, we find that the loss of power on
small scales, together with the delayed collapse of low-mass objects, results
in strong limits on the root-mean-square velocity dispersion v_rms of the WDM
particles at z=0. For fermions decoupling while relativistic, these limits are
equivalent to constraints on the mass m_X of the particles. The presence of a 4
billion solar mass black hole at z=5.8, believed to power the quasar SDSS
1044-1215, implies m_X > 0.5 keV (or v_rms < 0.10 km/s), assuming that the
quasar is unlensed and radiating at or below the Eddington limit. Reionization
by z=5.8 also implies a limit on m_X. If high-redshift galaxies produce
ionizing photons with an efficiency similar to their z=3 counterparts, we find
m_X > 1.2 keV (or v_rms < 0.03 km/s). However, given the uncertainties in
current measurements from the proximity effect of the ionizing background at
redshift 3, values of m_X as low as 0.75 keV (v_rms = 0.06 km/s) are not ruled
out. The limit weakens further if, instead, the ionizing-photon production
efficiency is greater at high z, but this limit will tighten considerably if
reionization is shown in the future to have occurred at higher redshifts. WDM
models with m_X < 1 keV (v_rms > 0.04 km/s) produce a low-luminosity cutoff in

"We consider a class of models for the redshift evolution (between $0\lsim z
\lsim 4$) of the observed optical and X-ray quasar luminosity functions (LFs),
with the following assumptions: (i) the mass-function of dark matter halos
follows the Press-Schechter theory, (ii) the black hole (BH) mass scales
linearly with the halo mass, (iii) quasars have a constant universal lifetime,
and (iv) a thin accretion disk provides the optical luminosity of quasars,
while the X-ray/optical flux ratio is calibrated from a sample of observed
quasars. The mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ onto quasar BHs is a free parameter
of the models, that we constrain using the observed LFs. The accretion rate
$\dot M$ inferred from either the optical or X-ray data under these assumptions
generally decreases as a function of cosmic time from $z \simeq 4$ to $z \simeq
0$. We find that a comparable accretion rate is inferred from the X-ray and
optical LF only if the X-ray/optical flux ratio decreases with BH mass. Near
$z\simeq 0$, $\dot M$ drops to substantially sub-Eddington values at which
advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) exist. Such a decline of $\dot M$,
possibly followed by a transition to radiatively inefficient ADAFs, could
explain both the absence of bright quasars in the local universe and the
faintness of accreting BHs at the centers of nearby galaxies. We argue that a
decline of the accretion rate of the quasar population is indeed expected in
cosmological structure formation models.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9810426v2
"The importance of angular momentum in regulating the sizes of galactic disks
and by this their star formation history is highlighted. Tidal torques and
accretion of satellites in principle provide enough angular momentum to form
disks with sizes that are in agreement with observations. However three major
problems have been identified that challenge cold dark matter theory and affect
models of galaxy evolution: (1) too much angular momentum is transferred from
the gas to the dark halos during infall, leading to disks with scale lengths
that are too small, (2) bulgeless disks require more specific angular momentum
than is generated cosmologically even if gas would not lose angular momentum
during infall, (3) gravitational torques and hierarchical merging produce a
specific angular momentum distribution that does not match the distribution
required to form exponential disks naturally; some gas has exceptionally high
angular momentum, leading to extended outer disks while another large gas
fraction will contain very little specific angular momentum and is expected to
fall into the galactic center, forming a massive and dominant bulge component.
Any self-consistent theory of galaxy formation will require to provide
solutions to these questions. Selective mass loss of low-angular-momentum gas
in an early phase of galaxy evolution currently seems to be the most promising
scenario. Such a process would have a strong affect on the early protogalactic
evolution phase, the origin and evolution of galactic morphologies and link
central properties of galaxies like the origin of central massive black holes

reionization is assumed to complete at zri~6. Our simulated galaxies are found
to be significantly smaller than the observed ones: while more than one half of
the galaxies observed by HST and VLT ranging from rest-frame UV to optical

at small radii (0.5kpc/h) due to high stellar concentration in the central
regions, larger than those of any well observed galaxies. Possible physical
mechanisms to resolve this serious problem include: (1) an early reionization
at zri>>6 to suppress gas condensation hence star formation, (2) a strong,
internal energetic feedback from stars or central black holes to reduce the
overall star formation efficiency, or (3) a substantial small-scale cutoff in
the matter power spectrum.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3150v3
"Recently, rapid observational and theoretical progress has established that
black holes (BHs) play a decisive role in the formation and evolution of
individual galaxies as well as galaxy groups and clusters. In particular, there
is compelling evidence that BHs vigorously interact with their surroundings in
the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating that any realistic model of
cluster formation needs to account for these processes. This is also suggested
by the failure of previous generations of hydrodynamical simulations without BH
physics to simultaneously account for the paucity of strong cooling flows in
clusters, the slope and amplitude of the observed cluster scaling relations,
and the high-luminosity cut-off of central cluster galaxies. Here we use
high-resolution cosmological simulations of a large cluster and group sample to
study how BHs affect their host systems. We focus on two specific properties,
the halo gas fraction and the X-ray luminosity-temperature scaling relation,
both of which are notoriously difficult to reproduce in self-consistent
hydrodynamical simulations. We show that BH feedback can solve both of these
issues, bringing them in excellent agreement with observations, without
alluding to the `cooling only' solution that produces unphysically bright
central galaxies. By comparing a large sample of simulated AGN-heated clusters

"We present the two--point correlation function (2PCF) of narrow-line active

are not detected in either the bluest (youngest) disk--dominated galaxies or
many of the reddest (oldest) galaxies. We show that the AGN 2PCF is dependent
on the luminosity of the narrow [OIII] emission line (L_{[OIII]}), with low

This is consistent with lower activity AGN residing in more massive galaxies
than higher activity AGN, and L_{[OIII]} providing a good indicator of the
fueling rate. Using a model relating halo mass to black hole mass in
cosmological simulations, we show that AGN hosted by ~ 10^{12} M_{odot} dark
matter halos have a 2PCF that matches that of the observed sample. This mass
scale implies a mean black hole mass for the sample of M_{BH} ~ 10^8 M_{odot}.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406357v1
"We propose the model of first quasars formation around the cluster of
rimordial black holes (PBHs). It is supposed, that mass fraction of the
universe ~10^-3 is composed of the compact clusters of PBHs, produced during
the phase transitions in the early universe. The clusters of PBHs become the
centers of dark matter condensation. As a result, the galaxies with massive
central black holes are formed. In the process of galaxies formation the
central black holes are growing due to accretion. This accretion is acompaned
by the early quasar activity.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412418v2
"We study the observational signatures of a potential population of
low-luminosity quasars at high redshifts in a LambdaCDM cosmology. We derive
the evolution of the quasar luminosity function at fainter luminosities and
higher redshifts than currently detected, based on three assumptions: (1) the
formation of dark-matter halos follows the Press-Schechter theory, (2) the
ratio of central black hole mass to halo mass is the same for all halos, and
(3) the light-curve of quasars, in Eddington units, is universal. We show that
a universal light-curve provides an excellent fit to the observed quasar
luminosity function at redshifts 2.6 < z < 4.5. By extrapolating the evolution
of this luminosity function to higher redshifts (4.5 < z < 20), we find that
the associated early population of low-luminosity quasars reionizes the
universe around redshift z=12. The reprocessing of the UV light of these
quasars by dust from early type II supernovae, distorts the microwave
background spectrum by a Compton y-parameter, y = 1e-5, comparable to the upper
limit set by COBE. The Next Generation Space Telescope could detect tens of
quasars from redshifts z > 10 per square arcminute, with its proposed 1nJy
sensitivity at 1-3.5 microns. Absorption spectra of several such quasars would
reveal the reionization history of the universe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9710208v1
"XEUS, the X-ray Evolving Universe Spectroscopy mission, is at present an
ESA-ISAS initiative for the study of the evolution of the hot Universe in the
post-Chandra/XMM-Newton era. The key science objectives of XEUS are: Search for
the origin, and subsequent study of growth, of the first massive black holes in
the early Universe; assessment of the formation of the first gravitationally
bound dark matter dominated systems and their evolution; study of the evolution
of metal synthesis up till the present epoch; characterization of the true
intergalactic medium.
  To reach these ambitious science goals the two salient characteristics of the
XEUS observatory entail: (1) Its effective spectroscopic grasp, combining a
sensitive area > 20 m^2 below 2 keV with a spectral resolution better than 2
eV. This allows significant detection of the most prominent X-ray emission
lines (e.g. O-VII, Si-XIII and Fe-XXV) in cosmologically distant sources
against the sky background; (2) Its angular resolving power, between 2 and 5
arc seconds, to minimize source confusion as well as noise due to the galactic
X-ray foreground emission.
  To accommodate these instrument requirements a mission concept has been
developed featuring an X-ray telescope of 50-m focal length, comprising two
laser-locked (separate) mirror and detector spacecraft's. The telescope is
injected in a low earth orbit with an inclination commensurate with the ISS. At
present an on-orbit growth of the mirror spacecraft is foreseen with the aid of
the ISS, raising the mirror diameter from 4.5 to 10 m. The detector spacecraft
will be replaced at 5 year intervals after run-out of consumables with an
associated upgrade of the focal plane package.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207283v1
"Lensing probabilities of quasars with image separations greater than
\Delta\theta and flux density ratios less than q_{\mathrm{r}} are calculated by
foreground dark matter halos in a flat, cosmological constant dominated
(\LambdaCDM) universe . The mass density of the lenses is taken to be the
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on all mass scales, plus a central point mass
for low-mass halos with M<M_c=5\times 10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\odot}. We introduce a
quantity M_{\mathrm{eff}}, which is a point mass ranging from 1 to 1000 times
the mass M_{\bullet} of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) inhabiting the center
of each galaxy, to describe the contributions of galactic central SMBHs and
galactic bulges to lensing probabilities. The lensing cross section and thus
the lensing probability are quite sensitive to the flux density ratio
q_{\mathrm{r}} of multiple images in our calculations. It is shown that, to
reproduce the lensing survey results of JVAS/CLASS for q_{\mathrm{r}}<10, about
20% of the bulge mass is needed as a point mass for each galaxy. Since there is
still considerable uncertainty regarding the value of the spectrum
normalization parameter \sigma_8, we investigate the effect of varying this
parameter within its entire observational range (from 0.7 to 1.1), and find
that low \sigma_8 values (\leq 0.7) are ruled out, and the best fit value is
\sigma_8\simeq 1.0.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301037v2
"We present detailed clustering measurements from the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey
(2QZ) in the redshift range 0.8<z<2.1. Using a flux limited sample of ~14,000
objects with effective redshift z_eff=1.47, we estimate the quasar projected
correlation function for separations 1<r/h^{-1} Mpc<20. We find that the
2-point correlation function in real space is well approximated by a power law
with slope gamma=1.5 pm 0.2 and comoving correlation length
r_0=4.8^{+0.9}_{-1.5} h^{-1} Mpc. Splitting the sample into three subsets based
on redshift, we find evidence for an increase of the clustering amplitude with
lookback time. For a fixed gamma, evolution of r_0 is detected at the 3.6 sigma
confidence level. The ratio between the quasar correlation function and the
mass autocorrelation function (derived adopting the concordance cosmological
model) is found to be scale independent. For a linear mass-clustering amplitude
sigma_8=0.8, the ``bias parameter'' decreases from b~3.9$ at z_eff=1.89 to
b~1.8 at z_eff=1.06. From the observed abundance and clustering, we infer how
quasars populate dark-matter haloes of different masses. We find that 2QZ
quasars sit in haloes with M>10^{12} M_sun and that the mean mass of their host
haloes is of the order of 10^{13} M_sun. The observed clustering is consistent
with assuming that the locally observed correlation between black-hole mass and
host-galaxy circular velocity is still valid at z>1. From the fraction of
haloes which contain active quasars, we infer that the characteristic quasar
lifetime is t_Q ~ a few x 10^7 yr at z~1 and approaches 10^8 yr at higher
redshifts.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406036v2
"Popular models for describing the luminosity-density profiles of dynamically
hot stellar systems (e.g., Jaffe, Hernquist, Dehnen) were constructed with the
desire to match the deprojected form of an R^{1/4} light-profile. Real
galaxies, however, are now known to have a range of different light-profile
shapes that scale with mass. Consequently, although highly useful, the above
models have implicit limitations, and this is illustrated here through their
application to a number of real galaxy density profiles. On the other hand, the
analytical density profile given by Prugniel & Simien (1997) closely matches
the deprojected form of Sersic R^{1/n} light-profiles - including deprojected
exponential light-profiles. It is thus applicable for describing bulges in
spiral galaxies, dwarf elliptical galaxies, and both ordinary and giant
elliptical galaxies. Here we provide simple equations, in terms of elementary
and special functions, for the gravitational potential and force associated
with this density profile. Furthermore, to match galaxies with partially
depleted cores, and better explore the supermassive black hole / galaxy
connection, we have added a power-law core to this density profile and derived
similar expressions for the potential and force of this hybrid profile.
Expressions for the mass and velocity dispersion, assuming isotropy, are also
given. These models may also prove appropriate for describing the dark matter
distribution in halos formed from LCDM cosmological simulations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506192v2
"A new view on our Galaxy has recently emerged, with large consequences on its
formation scenarios. Not only new dwarf satellites have been detected, still
orbiting and tidally disrupting, but also a multitude of stellar streams or
tidal debris have been observed suggesting the formation of the halo through
successive accretions. The large scatter in the age-metallicity relation in the
solar neighborhood points towards several accretion episodes, while the
chemical evolution of the disk requires a more or less continuous gas infall.
The global kinematics and morphology refined by large surveys such as 2MASS
suggest the existence of two embedded bars, as is frequently observed in
external galaxies. The mass of the central black hole has been refined through
stellar proper motions, and is compatible with the M$_{bh}$-$\sigma$ relation
valid for all bulges. The baryonic dark matter is no longer thought to lie in
compact objects, and on the contrary, more dark cold gas is revealed by
gamma-ray observations. The star forming history can be built, and confronted
to numerical models of galaxy evolution both through hierarchical and secular
scenarios. Our Galaxy plays thus the role of a prototype to probe galaxy
formation theories, and in particular thin and thick disk formation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507280v1

"It is now established that several of the Local Group dwarf Spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs) have large mass-to-light ratios. We consider the possibility
that the dark matter in the halos of dSphs is composed of massive black holes
with masses in the range 10^5 to 10^7 solar masses. We use direct N-body
simulations to determine the long term evolution of a two-component dSph
composed of a pressure-supported stellar population in a black hole halo. The
black holes are initially distributed according to a Navarro, Frenk & White
profile. For black hole masses between 10^5 and 10^6 solar masses, the dark
matter halo evolves towards a shallower inner profile in less than a Hubble
time. This suggests that black holes in this mass range might provide an
explanation for the origin of the dark matter cores inferred from observations
of Low Surface Brightness galaxy rotation curves. We compare the simulated
evolution of the stellar population with observed data for the Draco dSph. The
dependence of the heating rate on the black hole mass is determined, and an
upper limit of 10^5 solar masses is placed on the individual black holes
comprising the dark matter halo of Draco, if its present stellar distribution
is representative of the initial one. We also present a simple scaling argument
which demonstrates that the dynamical heating of an initially compact, though
not self-gravitating, stellar distribution might produce a remnant distribution
similar in extent to Draco after 10 Gyr, even for black hole masses somewhat in
excess of 10^5 solar masses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0311457v2
"The cosmological features of primordial black holes formed from collapsed
cosmic string loops are studied. Observational restrictions on a population of
primordial black holes are used to restrict $f$, the fraction of cosmic string
loops which collapse to form black holes, and $\mu$, the cosmic string
mass-per-unit-length. Using a realistic model of cosmic strings, we find the
strongest restriction on the parameters $f$ and $\mu$ is due to the energy
density in $100 MeV$ photons radiated by the black holes. We also find that
inert black hole remnants cannot serve as the dark matter. If earlier, crude
estimates of $f$ are reliable, our results severely restrict $\mu$, and
therefore limit the viability of the cosmic string large-scale structure
scenario.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9306221v1

Planck-charge cases, using the results in general relativity. Quantum black

"The comparison of the black hole mass function (BHMF) of active galactic
nuclei (AGN) relics with the measured mass function of the massive black holes
in galaxies provides strong evidence for the growth of massive black holes
being dominated by mass accretion. We derive the Eddington ratio distributions
as functions of black hole mass and redshift from a large AGN sample with
measured Eddington ratios given by Kollmeier et al. We find that, even at the
low mass end, most black holes are accreting at Eddington ratio ~0.2, which
implies that the objects accreting at extremely high rates should be rare or
such phases are very short. Using the derived Eddington ratios, we explore the
cosmological evolution of massive black holes with an AGN bolometric luminosity
function (LF). It is found that the resulted BHMF of AGN relics is unable to
match the measured local BHMF of galaxies for any value of (constant) radiative
efficiency. Motivated by Volonteri, Sikora & Lasota's study on the spin
evolution of massive black holes, we assume the radiative efficiency to be
dependent of black hole mass, i.e., it is low for M<10^8 solar masses and it
increases with black hole mass for black holes with >10^8 solar masses. We find
that the BHMF of AGN relics can roughly reproduce the local BHMF of galaxies if
the radiative efficiency ~0.08 for the black holes with <10^8 solar masses and
it increases to ~0.18 for black holes with >10^9 solar masses, which implies
that most massive black holes (>10^9 solar masses) are spinning very rapidly.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0759v2
"We use semi-analytic models implemented in the Millennium Simulation to
analyze the merging histories of dark matter haloes and of the galaxies that
reside in them. We assume that supermassive black holes only exist in galaxies
that have experienced at least one major merger. Only a few percent of galaxies
with stellar masses less than $M_* < 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ are predicted to have
experienced a major merger and to contain a black hole. The fraction of
galaxies with black holes increases very steeply at larger stellar masses. This
agrees well with the observed strong mass dependence of the fraction of nearby
galaxies that contain either low-luminosity (LINER-type) or higher-luminosity
(Seyfert or composite-type) AGN. We then investigate when the major mergers
that first create the black holes are predicted to occur. High mass galaxies
are predicted to have formed their black holes at very early epochs. The
majority of low mass galaxies never experience a major merger and hence do not
contain a black hole, but a significant fraction of the supermassive black
holes that do exist in low mass galaxies are predicted to have formed recently.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3530v1

PBH evaporation rate.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0604003v2
"Equilibrium configurations of weakly interacting fully degenerate fermionic
dark matter are considered at various scales in the Universe. We treat the
general situations for the gravity from Newtonian to general relativity and the
degeneracy from nonrelativistic to relativistic. A dimensionless equilibrium
configuration is specified by a single parameter regardless of particle
properties, the Fermi velocity at the center, and the scalings of mass and
length are specified by the rest mass and statistical weight of the dark matter
particle. We focus our attention to the flat-top nature of the mass column
density profile of the cluster of galaxies, A1689, recently reported by
Broadhurst et al. using gravitational lensing. We convert the column density
profile to a volume density profile assuming spherical symmetry and derive a 3D
encircled mass profile of A1689, which is compared with the model profiles of
degenerate fermion structures. The flat-top profile is reproduced. The
corresponding fermion mass ranges from 2 eV to 30 eV depending on the actual
scale of the degenerate structure. If massive neutrinos are the dominant dark
matter, the rest mass will be about 4.7 or 2.3 eV respectively for Majorana or
Dirac neutrinos. The mass and size of the degenerate structure are
$10^{14}M_\odot$ and 100 kpc for Majorana neutrinos, and
5$\times10^{14}M_\odot$ and 300 kpc for Dirac neutrinos. If we identify the
fermions as heavier sterile neutrinos, they yield the characteristic mass
hierarchy of black holes; giant black hole at the center of a galaxy and the
intermediate mass black holes. Thus we propose the possibility that the mass
hierarchy of fermions determines that of black holes in the Universe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506623v1
"We explore possible effects of vacuum energy on the evolution of black holes.
If the universe contains a cosmological constant, and if black holes can absorb

suppressed. For the magnitude of the cosmological constant suggested by current
observations, black holes larger than $\sim 4 \times 10^{24}$ g would accrete
energy rather than evaporate. In this scenario, all stellar and supermassive

significantly greater in higher dimensional space with potential implications
to the initial entropy of the universe. A case is made that LBH are the dark
matter of the universe, and can manifest themselves as the core energy source
of ball lightning (BL). The LBH incidence rate on earth is related to BL
occurrence and has the potential of aiding in the determination of the
distribution of LBH and hence dark matter in the universe. Examination of LBH

"The total number of degrees of freedom of a d-dimensional body in n-space is
derived so that equipartition of energy may be applied to a possibly
n-dimensional early universe. A comparison is made of a range of proposals to
include free and bound black holes as either a small component or the dominant
constituent of dark matter in the universe. The hypothesis that dark matter
consists in part of atomic gravitationally bound primordial black holes is
closely examined in 3-space, as well as in n-space; and the Chavda and Chavda
holeum hypothesis is found to be flawed. Blackbody and Hawking radiation are
generalized to n-space, and Hawking radiation is shown to be simply
proportional to the black hole density. The importance of quantum gravity in
understanding the role of early universe dark matter is undermined because
present approaches to a theory of quantum gravity violate the equivalence

"We investigate a model in which galactic nuclei form via the coalescence of
pre-existing stellar systems containing supermassive black holes. Merger
simulations are carried out using N-body algorithms that can follow the
formation and decay of a black-hole binary and its effect on the surrounding
stars down to sub-parsec scales. Our initial stellar systems have steep central
density cusps similar to those in low-luminosity elliptical galaxies. Formation
of a black-hole binary transfers energy to the stars and lowers the central
density; continued decay of the binary creates a ~1/r density cusp similar to
those observed in bright elliptical galaxies, with a break radius that extends
well beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the black holes. The decay
of the black hole binary is followed over a factor of ~20 in separation after
formation of a hard binary, considerably farther than in previous simulations.
We see almost no dependence of the binary's decay rate on number of particles
in the simulation, contrary to earlier studies in which a lower initial density
of stars led to a more rapid depletion of the binary's loss cone. We
nevertheless argue that the decay of a black hole binary in a real galaxy would
be expected to stall at separations of 0.01-1 pc unless some additional
mechanism is able to extract energy from the binary. Our results support a
picture in which the observed dependence of nuclear cusp slope on galaxy
luminosity is a consequence of galaxy interactions. We also discuss the
implications of our results for the survivability of dark-matter cusps.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103350v1

examination of the possibility [Chen and Adler (2003), MacGibbon (1987)] that
the dark matter is comprised of Planck-mass black hole remnants (BHR's). As an
example we focus on a particular scenario [Chen (2003)] in which the black
holes form from quantum perturbations that were generated during hybrid
inflation. We find the correspondence between hybrid inflation parameters and
the range of initial PBH masses that would allow BHR's to comprise the dark

"Gravitational waves from the coalescence of binary black holes carry away
linear momentum, causing center of mass recoil. This ""radiation rocket"" effect
has important implications for systems with escape speeds of order the recoil
velocity. We revisit this problem using black hole perturbation theory,
treating the binary as a test mass spiraling into a spinning hole. For extreme
mass ratios (q = m1/m2 << 1) we compute the recoil for the slow inspiral epoch
of binary coalescence very accurately; these results can be extrapolated to q ~
0.4 with modest accuracy. Although the recoil from the final plunge contributes
significantly to the final recoil, we are only able to make crude estimates of
its magnitude. We find that the recoil can easily reach ~ 100-200 km/s, but
most likely does not exceed ~ 500 km/s. Though much lower than previous
estimates, this recoil is large enough to have important astrophysical
consequences. These include the ejection of black holes from globular clusters,

"We study the distribution of fermionic dark matter at the center of galaxies
using NFW, Moore and isothermal density profiles and show that dark matter
becomes degenerate for particle masses of a few {\rm keV} and for distances

forms after galaxy merging and boosts the growth of supermassive black holes at
the center of galaxies. To explain the galactic center black hole of mass of
$\sim 3.5 \times 10^{6}M_{\odot}$ and a supermassive black hole of $\sim 3

$0.6 {\rm keV}$ and $82 {\rm keV}$. The lower limit on the dark matter mass is
improved to {\rm 7 keV} if exact solutions of Poisson's equation are used in

"We consider the consequences of SIDM for a velocity dependent cross section
per unit mass. Accretion of SIDM onto seed black holes can produce supermassive
black holes that are too large for certain combinations of parameters,which is
used to obtain a new constraint on the dark matter interaction. Constraints due
to other considerations are presented and previous ones are generalized. The
black hole constraint is extremely sensitive to the slope \alpha, of the inner
density profile of dark halos. For the most probable value of \alpha=1.3, there
exists a narrow range in parameter space, such that all constraints are
satisfied. However, the adiabatic compression of the dark halo by baryons as
they cool and contract in normal galaxies yields a steeper cusp, \alpha=1.7.
This gives a tighter constraint, which would exclude SIDM as a possible
solution to the purported problems with CDM in the absence of other dynamical
processes. Nevertheless, SIDM with parameters consistent with this stronger
constraint, can explain the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in the centers
of galaxies. A ``best fit'' model is presented which reproduces the
supermassive black hole masses and their observed correlations with the
velocity dispersion of the host bulges. Specifically, the fourth power
dependence of black hole mass on velocity dispersion is a direct consequence of
the power spectrum having an index of n=-2. Although the dark matter collision
rates for this model are too small to directly remedy problems with CDM,
mergers between dark halos harboring supermassive black holes at high redshift
could ameliorate the cuspy halo problem. This scenario also explains the lack
of comparable supermassive black holes in bulgeless galaxies like M33.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0108203v2

"We investigate the evolution of high redshift seed black hole masses at late
times and their observational signatures. The massive black hole seeds studied
here form at extremely high redshifts from the direct collapse of pre-galactic
gas discs. Populating dark matter halos with seeds formed in this way, we
follow the mass assembly of these black holes to the present time using a
Monte-Carlo merger tree. Using this machinery we predict the black hole mass
function at high redshifts and at the present time; the integrated mass density
of black holes and the luminosity function of accreting black holes as a
function of redshift. These predictions are made for a set of three seed models
with varying black hole formation efficiency. Given the accuracy of current
observational constraints, all 3 models can be adequately fit. Discrimination
between the models appears predominantly at the low mass end of the present day
black hole mass function which is not observationally well constrained.
However, all our models predict that low surface brightness, bulgeless galaxies
with large discs are least likely to be sites for the formation of massive seed
black holes at high redshifts. The efficiency of seed formation at high
redshifts has a direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction in
galaxies at z=0. This effect is more pronounced for low mass galaxies. This is
the key discriminant between the models studied here and the Population III
remnant seed model. We find that there exists a population of low mass galaxies
that do not host nuclear black holes. Our prediction of the shape of the black
hole mass - velocity dispersion relation at the low mass end is in agreement
with the recent observational determination from the census of low mass
galaxies in the Virgo cluster.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0529v2
"We present a clustering analysis of QSOs using over 20000 objects from the
final catalogue of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ), measuring the z-space
correlation function, xi(s). When averaged over the range 0.3<z<2.2 we find
that xi(s) is flat on small scales, steepening on scales above ~25h-1Mpc. In a
WMAP/2dF cosmology we find a best fit power law with s_0=5.48+0.42-0.48h-1Mpc
and gamma=1.20+-0.10 on scales s=1-25h-1Mpc. A CDM model assuming WMAP/2dF
cosmological parameters is a good description of the QSO xi(s) after accounting
for non-linear clustering and z-space distortions, and a linear bias of
b_qso(z=1.35)=2.02+-0.07. We subdivide the 2QZ into 10 redshift intervals from
z=0.53 to 2.48 and find a significant increase in clustering amplitude at high
redshift in the WMAP/2dF cosmology. We derive the bias of the QSOs which is a
strong function of redshift with b_qso(z=0.53)=1.13+-0.18 and
b_qso(z=2.48)=4.24+-0.53. We use these bias values to derive the mean dark
matter halo (DMH) mass occupied by the QSOs. At all redshifts 2QZ QSOs inhabit
approximately the same mass DMHs with M_DH=(3.0+-1.6)x10^12h-1M_sun, which is
close to the characteristic mass in the Press-Schechter mass function, M*, at
z=0. If the relation between black hole (BH) mass and M_DH or host velocity
dispersion does not evolve, then we find that the accretion efficiency
(L/L_edd) for L* QSOs is approximately constant with redshift. Thus the fading
of the QSO population from z~2 to 0 appears to be due to less massive BHs being
active at low redshift. We apply different methods to estimate, t_qso, the
active lifetime of QSOs and constrain this to be in the range 4x10^6-6x10^8
years at z~2. (Abridged).",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409314v1
"A study is made of the behavior of massive black holes in disk galaxies that
have received an impulsive kick from a merger or a sustained acceleration from
an asymmetric jet. The motion of the gas, stars, dark matter, and massive black
hole are calculated using the GADGET-2 simulation code. The massive black hole
escapes the galaxy for kick velocities above about 600 km/s or accelerations
above about 4*10^{-8} cm/s^2 over time-scales of the order of 10^8 yr. For
smaller velocity kicks or smaller accelerations, the black hole oscillates
about the center of mass with a frequency which decreases as the kick velocity
or acceleration increases. The black hole displacements may give rise to
observable nonaxisymmetries in the morphology and dynamics of the stellar and
gaseous disk of the galaxy. In some cases the dynamical center of the galaxy is
seen to be displaced towards the direction of the BH acceleration with a
characteristic ``tongue--'' shaped extension of the velocity contours on the
side of the galaxy opposite the acceleration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2058v1

(SMBHs) in the centers of most nearby galaxies. The mass estimates for these

The accretion history of SMBHs can be reconstructed using observations at high

utilizes observations in various wavebands, and a semi-analytic approach that
starts with a theoretical framework and a set of assumptions with a view to
matching observations. Both techniques have been pursued in the context of the

total mass budget of the universe. We review the candidates for particle dark
matter and discuss the prospects for direct detection (via interaction of dark
matter particles with laboratory detectors) and indirect detection (via
observations of the products of dark matter self-annihilations), focusing in
particular on the Galactic center, which is among the most promising targets
for indirect detection studies. The gravitational potential at the Galactic
center is dominated by stars and by the supermassive black hole, and the dark
matter distribution is expected to evolve on sub-parsec scales due to
interaction with these components. We discuss the dominant interaction
mechanisms and show how they can be used to rule out certain extreme models for
the dark matter distribution, thus increasing the information that can be
gleaned from indirect detection searches.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504422v1
"Many questions in physical cosmology regarding the thermal history of the
intergalactic medium, chemical enrichment, reionization, etc. are thought to be
intimately related to the nature and evolution of pregalactic structure. In
particular the efficiency of primordial star formation and the primordial IMF
are of special interest. We present results from high resolution
three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations that follow the collapse
of primordial molecular clouds and their subsequent fragmentation within a
cosmologically representative volume. Comoving scales from 128 kpc down to 0.5
pc are followed accurately. Dark matter dynamics, hydrodynamics and all
relevant chemical and radiative processes (cooling) are followed
self-consistently for a cluster normalized CDM structure formation model.
Primordial molecular clouds with ~100,000 solar masses are assembled by mergers
of multiple objects that have formed hydrogen molecules in the gas phase with a
fractional abundance of <~ 10^-4. As the subclumps merge cooling decreases the
temperature to ~200 Kelvin in multiple ""cold pockets"" of the merger product.
Within these cold pockets, quasi-hydrostatically contracting cores with masses
\~ 100 M_sun and number densities > 100,000/cm^3 are found. We find that less
than 1% of the primordial gas in such small scale structures cools and
collapses to sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star
formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that the formation of very massive
objects, massive black holes, fragmentation of a large fraction of baryons into
brown dwars or Jupiter size fragments seems, in contrast to various claims in
the literature, very unlikely. The expected escape fraction of UV photons with

in cosmic rays observed by the Auger group. Similar processes of decay of

compact jets with flat-spectrum, and 2) sporadic extended jets with
steep-spectrum and apparent superluminal motions. Besides, the most common

ray signal due to dark matter annihilation in this globular cluster. Starting
from an initial NFW matter profile, with density parameters consistent with G1

"(ABRIDGED) We present a model in which the seeds of supermassive black holes
form from the lowest angular momentum gas in proto-galaxies at high redshift.
We show that this leads to a correlation between black hole masses and spheroid
properties, as observed today. We assume that gas in early-forming, rare halos
has a distribution of specific angular momentum similar to that expected for
dark matter halos. This distribution has a significant low angular momentum
tail which implies that every proto-galaxy should contain gas that ends up in a
high-density disc. In halos more massive than a critical threshold of
\~10^8Msun, the discs are gravitationally unstable, and experience an efficient
Lin-Pringle viscosity that allows mass inflow. This process continues until the
first massive stars disrupt the disc. Black holes are created with a
characteristic mass of ~10^5 Msun, independent of the redshift of formation.
This serves as a lower bound for black-hole masses in galaxies today. The
comoving mass density of black hole seeds grows with time, and saturates when
cosmic reionization stops gas cooling in these low-mass systems. By z~15, the
comoving mass density becomes comparable to that inferred from observations,
with room for appropriate additional luminous growth during a later quasar
accretion phase. Hierarchical merging after z~15 naturally leads to a linear
correlation between black-hole mass and stellar spheroid mass, with negligible
black hole masses in disc-dominated galaxies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0311487v2
"We describe a mechanism by which supermassive black holes can form directly
in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need for seed black holes left over
from early star formation. Self-gravitating gas in dark matter halos can lose
angular momentum rapidly via runaway, global dynamical instabilities, the
so-called ""bars within bars"" mechanism. This leads to the rapid buildup of a
dense, self-gravitating core supported by gas pressure - surrounded by a
radiation pressure-dominated envelope - which gradually contracts and is
compressed further by subsequent infall. These conditions lead to such high
temperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically by
thermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation and rapid growth of a
central black hole.
  We estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typical
conditions in metal-free halos with T_vir ~ 10^4 K, which are the most likely
to be susceptible to runaway infall. The initial black hole should have a mass
of <~20 solar masses, but in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate
until it reaches ~ 10^4-10^6 solar masses. Rapid growth may be limited by
feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the mass supply by
star formation or halo mergers. Even if super-Eddington growth stops at
\~10^3-10^4 solar masses, this process would give black holes ample time to
attain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds
for all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602363v2

this correlation, and we find a striking agreement with a corresponding
relation for elliptical galaxies. We combine this correlation with the
well-known MBH-sigma relation to obtain a tight correlation between the
circular velocities of galaxies and the masses of the supermassive black holes
they host. This correlation is the observational evidence for an intimate link
between dark matter haloes and supermassive black holes. Apart from being an

"While there exist various candidates, the identification of dark matter
remains unresolved. Recently it was argued that the generalized uncertainty
principle (GUP) may prevent a black hole from evaporating completely, and as a
result there should exist a Planck-size BHR at the end of its evaporation. We
speculate that the stability of BHR may be further protected by supersymmetry
in the form of extremal black hole. If this is indeed the case and if a
sufficient amount of small black holes can be produced in the early universe,
then the resultant BHRs can be an interesting candidate for DM. We demonstrate
that this is the case in the hybrid inflation model. By assuming BHR as DM, our
notion imposes a constraint on the hybrid inflation potential. We show that
such a constraint is not fine-tuned. Possible observational signatures are
briefly discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406514v1
"We show that the hierarchical assembly of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes
preserves the memory of the initial conditions. Using N-body cosmological
simulations, we demonstrate that the present-day spatial distribution and
kinematics of objects that formed within early (z > 10) protogalactic systems
(old stars, satellite galaxies, globular clusters, massive black holes, etc.)
depends mostly on the rarity of the peak of the primordial density field which
they originally belonged to. Only for objects forming at lower redshifts the
exact formation site within the progenitor halo (e.g. whether near the center
or in an extended disk) becomes important. In present-day haloes, material from
the rarer early peaks is more centrally concentrated and falls off more steeply
with radius compared to the overall mass distribution, it has a lower velocity
dispersion, moves on more radial orbits, and has a more elongated shape.
Population II stars that formed within protogalactic haloes collapsing from
>2.5 sigma fluctuations would follow today a r^{-3.5} density profile with a
half-light radius of 17 kpc and a velocity anisotropy that increases from
isotropic in the inner regions to nearly radial at the halo edge. This agrees
well with the radial velocity dispersion profile of Galaxy halo stars from
Battaglia et al. (2005) and with the anisotropic orbits of nearby halo stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506615v4
"The annihilation of neutralino dark matter may result in observable signals
in different wavelength. In the present paper we will discuss the effect of
neutralino annihilation in the halo of our Galaxy and in its center. According
to high resolution cold dark matter simulations, large virialized halos are
formed through the constant merging of smaller halos appeared at previous
times. At each epoch, dark matter halos have then a clumpy component which is
made of these merging subhalos. The annihilation of dark matter in these
clumps, always present in the halo of our Galaxy, may be responsible for
appreciable fluxes of $\gamma$-rays, potentially detectable. We find that,
depending on the fundamental parameters of the clump density profile and on the
distribution of clumps in the Galactic halo, the contribution to the diffuse
$\gamma$-ray background from clumps could be used to obtain constraints on the
neutralino properties such as mass and annihilation cross section. On the other
hand the annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the galactic center may
result in radio signals. At the galactic center, infact, the accretion flow
onto the central black hole sustains strong magnetic fields that can induce
synchrotron emission, in the radio wavelength, by electrons and positrons
generated in neutralino annihilations during advection onto the black hole. We
find that the observed emission from the galactic center is consistent with
neutralinos following a Navarro Frenk and White density profile at the galactic
center while it is inconsistent with the presence of a spike density profile,
supposed to be generated by the formation history of the central black hole.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405110v1
"(Shortened) Weakly Interacting Massive Particles are often said to be the
best Dark Matter candidates. Studies have shown however that rather large Dark
Matter-photon or Dark Matter-baryon interactions could be allowed by cosmology.
Here we address the question of the role of the Dark Matter interactions in
more detail to determine at which extent Dark Matter has to be necessarily
weakly interacting. To this purpose, we compute the collisional damping (and
free-streaming) lengths of generic interacting Dark Matter candidates and
compare them to the scale of the smallest primordial structures known to exist
in the Universe. We obtain necessary conditions that any candidate must
satisfy. We point out the existence of new Dark Matter scenarios and exhibit
new damping regimes. For example, an interacting candidate may bear a similar
damping than that of collisionless Warm Dark Matter particles. The main
difference is due to the Dark Matter coupling to interacting (or even
freely-propagating) species. Our approach yields a general classification of
Dark Matter candidates which extends the definitions of the usual Cold, Warm

considered.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0410591v1

A ghost condensate defines a hypersurface-orthogonal congruence of timelike

It is argued that the ghost condensate in this picture approximately
corresponds to a congruence of geodesics. In other words, the ghost condensate
accretes into a black hole just like a pressure-less dust. Correspondingly, if
the energy density of the ghost condensate at large distance is set to an
extremely small value by cosmic expansion then the late-time accretion rate of
the ghost condensate should be negligible. The accretion rate remains very
small even if effects of higher derivative terms are taken into account,
provided that the black hole is sufficiently large. It is also discussed how to
reconcile the black hole accretion with the possibility that the ghost
condensate might behave like dark matter.",http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0502189v2

"Dark matter annihilation in so-called ``spikes'' near black holes is believed
to be an important method of indirect dark matter detection. In the case of
circular particle orbits, the density profile of dark matter has a plateau at
small radii, the maximal density being limited by the annihilation
cross-section. However, in the general case of arbitrary velocity anisotropy
the situation is different. Particulary, for isotropic velocity distribution
the density profile cannot be shallower than r^{-1/2} in the very centre.
Indeed, a detailed study reveals that in many cases the term ``annihilation
plateau'' is misleading, as the density actually continues to rise towards
small radii and forms a weak cusp, rho ~ r^{-(beta+1/2)}, where beta is the
anisotropy coefficient. The annihilation flux, however, does not change much in
the latter case, if averaged over an area larger than the annihilation radius.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3334v2

"The prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is often
considered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in curved space-time.
Yet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions: that ordinary physics may
be applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy scales increasing exponentially
without bound; and that quantum-gravitational effects may be neglected. Various
suggestions have been put forward to address these issues: that they might be
explained away by lessons from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is
indeed successfully reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link
provided by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies the
prediction.
  This paper explains the nature of the difficulties, and reviews the proposals
that have been put forward to deal with them. None of the proposals put forward
can so far be considered to be really successful, and simple dimensional
arguments show that quantum-gravitational effects might well alter the
evaporation process outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical
treatment will require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some
regimes. Until then, no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation by
black holes is likely to be made.
  The possibility that non-radiating ""mini"" black holes exist should be taken

"We investigate the recently proposed hybrid inflation models with two stages
of inflation. We show that quantum fluctuations at the time corresponding to
the phase transition between the two inflationary stages can trigger the
formation of a large number of inflating topological defects. In order to study
density perturbations in these models we develop a new method to calculate
density perturbations in a system of two scalar fields. We show that density
perturbations in hybrid inflation models of the new type can be very large on
the scale corresponding to the phase transition. The resulting density
inhomogeneities lead to a copious production of black holes. This could be an
argument against hybrid inflation models with two stages of inflation. However,
we find a class of models where this problem can be easily avoided. The number
of black holes produced in these models can be made extremely small, but in
general it could be sufficiently large to have important cosmological and
astrophysical implications. In particular, for certain values of parameters
these black holes may constitute the dark matter in the universe. It is also
possible to have hybrid models with two stages of inflation where the black
hole production is not suppressed, but where the typical masses of the black

limit on {\em n} is derived by normalizing the spectrum at the quadrupole scale
and considering the possible overproduction of Planck mass relics formed in the
final stage of primordial black hole evaporation. In the inflationary Universe
with the maximum reheating temperature compatible with the observed quadrupole
anisotropy, the upper limit is $n=1.4$, but it is slightly weaker for lower
reheat temperatures. This limit applies over 57 decades of mass and is
therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and any gravitational wave
contribution to the quadrupole anisotropy. It is also independent of the dark
matter content of the Universe and therefore the bias parameter. In some
circumstances, there may be an extended dust-like phase between the end of
inflation and reheating. In this case, primordial black holes form more
abundantly and the upper limit is $n=1.3$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9405027v1
"The origin of supermassive black holes in the galactic nuclei is quite
uncertain in spite of extensive set of observational data. We review the known
scenarios of galactic and cosmological formation of supermassive black holes.
The common drawback of galactic scenarios is a lack of time and shortage of
matter supply for building the supermassive black holes in all galaxies by
means of accretion and merging. The cosmological scenarios are only
fragmentarily developed but propose and pretend to an universal formation
mechanism for supermassive black holes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0070v2
"We explore the possibility that massive black holes comprise a significant
fraction of the dark matter of our galaxy by studying the dissolution of
galactic globular clusters bombarded by them. In our simulations, we evolve the
clusters along a sequence of King models determined by changes of state
resulting from collisions with the black holes. The results divide naturally
into regimes of `small' and `large' black hole mass. `Small' black holes do not
destroy clusters in single collisions; their effect is primarily cumulative,
leading to a relation between $\mbh$ and $\fhalo$, the fraction of the halo in
black holes of mass $\mbh$, which is $\fhalo\mbh < $ constant (up to
logarithmic corrections). For $\fhalo=1$, we find $\mbh \simless 10^{3} \msun$
by requiring survival of the same clusters studied by Moore (1993), who
neglected cluster evolution, mass loss, and stochasticity of energy inputs in
his estimates, but reached a similar conclusion. `Large' black holes may not
penetrate a cluster without disrupting it; their effect is mainly catastrophic
(close collisions), but also partly cumulative (distant collisions). In the
large $\mbh$ limit, $\fhalo$ (but not $\mbh$) can be constrained by computing
the probability that a cluster survives a combination of close, destructive
encounters and distant, nondestructive encounters. We find that it is unlikely
that $\fhalo \simgreat 0.3$ by requiring 50 per cent survival probability for
Moore's clusters over $10^{10}$ years.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811370v1
"We investigate how central black holes (BHs) inhabited in galactic dark halos
could affect strong gravitational lensing. The distribution of integral lensing
probability with image separations are calculated for quasars of redshift 1.5
by foreground dark matter halos. The mass density of dark halos is taken to be
the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile such that, when the mass of a halo is
less than $10^{14} M_{\sun}$, its central black holes or a bulge is included as
a point mass. The relationship between the masses $M_{\bullet}$ of supermassive
black holes and the total gravitational mass $M_{\mathrm{DM}}$ of their host
galaxy is adopted from the most recent literature. Only a flat $\Lambda$CDM
model is considered here. It is shown that, while a single black hole for each
galaxy contributes considerable but not sufficient lensing probabilities at
small image separations compared with those without black holes, the bulges
(which are about 100--1000 times larger in mass than a typical black hole)
would definitely contribute enough probabilities at small image separations,
although it gives too high probabilities at large separation angles compared
with lensing observations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207268v2
"Black holes with masses M_BH~10^{8.5} M_Sun dominate the accretion history of
the Universe. These black hole masses are typical of those found in
radio-selected galaxies today, suggesting that the giant elliptical hosts of
low redshift radio galaxies were the hosts of powerful, mostly radio-quiet,
quasars in the high redshift Universe. The reason that all radio galaxies are
found in such hosts may be the correlation of black hole mass with radio
luminosity, but it is emphasized that accretion rate too plays an important
role in the production of powerful radio jets. The tight K-z relation of
luminous, high redshift, radio galaxies is probably a selection effect due to
the selection on high black hole masses and high accretion rates. Luminous
radio galaxies are the radio-loud part of the ``quasar-2'' population, and the
ratio of radio-loud quasars to luminous radio galaxies, about 1:1, is so far
our only good estimate of the relative numbers of quasar-1s and quasar-2s. The
numbers of radio-quiet and radio-intermediate quasar-2s are still uncertain,
but a much larger population than the quasar-1s would conflict with constraints
from the present-day black hole mass density. A comparison of the number
densities of dark matter haloes and the high redshift quasars, however,
suggests that there are plenty of dark haloes capable of hosting the known high
redshift AGN and thus room for a significant, but not huge, quasar-2
population.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303348v1
"Recent observations of near-infrared and X-ray flares from Sagittarius A*,
which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the Galactic center, show
that the source exhibits about 20-minute periodic variability. Here we provide
arguments based on a quantitative analysis that supermassive objects at
galactic centers may be bubbles of dark matter axions rather than black holes.
An oscillating axion bubble can explain periodic variability of Sagittarius A*
and yields the axion mass about 0.6 meV which fits in the open axion mass
window. The bubble scenario with no other free parameters explains lack of
supermassive ""black holes"" with mass M<10^6 M_{Sun}. Low-mass bubbles decay
fast and as a result are very rare. We also found that the mass of an axion
bubble can not exceed 1.5\times 10^9 M_{Sun}, in agreement with the upper limit
on the supermassive ""black hole"" mass obtained from observations. Our finding,
if confirmed, suggests that Einstein general relativity is invalid for strong
gravity and the gravitational field for the bubble effectively becomes
repulsive at large potential. Imaging a shadow of the ""black hole"" at the
Galactic center with VLBI in the next decade can distinguish between the black
hole and the oscillating axion bubble scenarios. In the case of axion bubble, a
steady shadow will not be observed. Instead, the shadow will appear and
disappear periodically with a period of about 20 min.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607179v2
"We present three reasons for the formation of gravitational bound states of
primordial black holes,called holeums,in the early universe.Using Newtonian
gravity and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics we find a purely quantum
mechanical mass-dependant exclusion property for the nonoverlap of the
constituent black holes in a holeum.This ensures that the holeum occupies space
just like ordinary matter.A holeum emits only gravitational radiation whose
spectrum is an exact analogue of that of a hydrogen atom. A part of this
spectrum lies in the region accessible to the detectors being built.The holeums
would form haloes around the galaxies and would be an important component of
the dark matter in the universe today.They may also be the constituents of the
invisible domain walls in the universe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0308054v1
"If supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are the energy sources that power quasars
and active galactic nuclei, then QSO SDSS 1148+5251, the quasar with the
highest redshift (z_QSO=6.43), hosts a supermassive black hole formed within
0.9 Gyr after the Big Bang. This requirement places constraints on the
cosmological formation of SMBHs, believed to grow from smaller initial seeds by
a combination of accretion and mergers. We focus on gas accretion onto seeds
produced by the collapse of Pop III stars at high redshift. We incorporate the
results of recent relativistic, MHD simulations of disk accretion onto Kerr
black holes to track the coupled evolution of the masses and spins of the
holes. We allow for an additional amplification of ~10^4 in the mass of a
typical seed due to mergers, consistent with recent Monte Carlo simulations of
hierarchical mergers of cold, dark matter halos containing black hole seeds. We
find that the growth of Pop III black hole seeds to ~10^9 M_sun by z_QSO = 6.43
favors MHD accretion disks over standard thin disks. MHD disks tend to drive
the holes to a submaximal equilibrium spin rate a/M ~ 0.95 and radiation
efficiency epsilon_M ~ 0.2, while standard thin disks drive them to maximal
spin (a/M = 1) and efficiency (epsilon_M = 0.42). This small difference in
efficiency results in a huge difference in mass amplification by accretion at
the Eddington limit. The MHD equilibrium efficiency is consistent with the
observed ratio of the QSO plus AGN luminosity density to the local SMBH mass
density. Our prototype analysis is designed to stimulate the incorporation of
results from relativistic stellar collapse and MHD accretion simulations in
future Monte Carlo simulations of hierarchical structure formation to better
determine the cosmological role of SMBHs and their mass and spin distributions.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411156v1
"We investigate the possibility that present-day galaxies and their dark
matter haloes contain a population of massive black holes (MBHs) that form by
hierarchical merging of the black hole remnants of the first stars in the
Universe. Some of the MBHs may be large enough or close enough to the centre of
the galactic host that they merge within a Hubble time. We estimate to what
extent this process could contribute to the mass of the super-massive black
holes (SMBHs) observed in galactic centres today. The relation between SMBH and
galactic bulge mass in our model displays the same slope as that found in
observations. Many MBHs will not reach the centre of the host halo, however,
but continue to orbit within it. In doing so MBHs may remain associated with
remnants of the satellite halo systems of which they were previously a part.
Using a semi-analytical approach that explicitly accounts for dynamical
friction, tidal disruption and encounters with galactic disks, we follow the
hierarchical merging of MBH systems and their subsequent dynamical evolution
inside the respective host haloes. We predict the mass and abundance of MBHs in
present-day galactic haloes, and also estimate the MBH mass accretion rates as
well as bolometric luminosities for two different accretion scenarios. MBHs
that have not undergone recent merging will retain associated dark matter cusps
that were enhanced by black hole accretion growth, and may be possible sources
of gamma rays via neutralino annihilations.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307171v1
"We determine the total enclosed mass profile from 0.7 to 35 kpc in the
elliptical galaxy NGC 4636 based on the hot interstellar medium temperature
profile measured using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and other X-ray and
optical data. The total mass increases as radius to the power 1.2 to a good
approximation over this range in radii, attaining a total of 1.5 trillion solar
masses (corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of 40 solar masses per solar
visual luminosity) at 35 kpc. We find that at least half, and as much as 80%,
of the mass within the optical half-light radius is non-luminous, implying that
NGC 4636 has an exceptionally low baryon fraction. The large inferred dark
matter concentration and central dark matter density, consistent with the upper
end of the range expected for standard cold dark matter halos, imply that
mechanisms proposed to explain low dark matter densities in less massive
galaxies (e.g., self-interacting dark matter, warm dark matter, explosive
feedback) are not effective in elliptical galaxies (and presumably, by
extension, in galaxy clusters). The composite (black hole, stars, and dark
matter) mass distribution has a generally steep slope with no core, consistent
with gravitational lensing studies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0208090v1

(1986), they reach the remarkable conclusion that black holes with current mass
greater than about 2*10^(-9) Msun will not Hawking evaporate in the distant
future, but will instead absorb vacuum energy and grow to roughly the de Sitter

importance of gas accretion in black hole growth, from early supercritical
Eddington accretion to gas-poor hierarchical assembly. Following a galaxy
merger, black holes are expected to form, inspiral and merge after strongly
radiating energy via gravitational waves. For each binary black hole inspiral

function of time. We will calculate the black hole mass assembly history for
several black hole growth scenerios, so that we can explore tests to
characterize each model observationally. In particular, we will study how well
LISA observations will be able to distinguish between these very different
assembly scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608493v2

could begin as a hot core and a cold dark matter shell. The 21 cm. radiation
data has identified baryon sized particles as cold dark matter. Highly squeezed
nucleons will not decompose to produce antimatter. The flatness of the Universe

"The influence of dark matter (DM) on the growth of supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) in galaxies is studied. It is shown that gravitational scattering of DM
particles on bulge stars leads to diffusion of DM in phase space {m, m_z, I}

diffusion coefficients are calculated for different bulge models, and it is
argued that the diffusion along 'm' axis is the most important effect. It is
shown that this process leads to noticeable flow of DM into the black hole
(BH), resulting in its power-law growth: M_{bh} ~ t^{9/16}. Comparison with
observational data shows that, in principle, this effect may explain observed
masses of SMBHs. Special attention is paid to the corrections related to the
innermost region of BH gravitational influence and the diffusion along 'I'
axis. Their influence on the BH growth law is shown to be negligible in most
cases.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307524v2

created from vacuum by the gravitation of the expanding Universe and their
decay led to the observable baryon charge. Some part of these particles with
the lifetime larger than the time of breaking of the Grand Unification symmetry
became metastable and survived up to the modern time as dark matter. However in
active galactic nuclei due to large energies of dark matter particles swallowed
by the black hole the opposite process can occur. Dark matter particles become
interacting. Their decay on visible particles at the Grand Unification energies
leads to the flow of ultra high energy cosmic rays observed by the Auger group.
Numerical estimates of the effect leading to the observable numbers are given.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.2667v1
"Many lines of evidence suggest that nonbaryonic dark matter constitutes
roughly 30% of the critical closure density, but the composition of this dark
matter is unknown. One class of candidates for the dark matter is compact
objects formed in the early universe, with typical masses M between 0.1 and 1
solar masses to correspond to the mass scale of objects found with microlensing
observing projects. Specific candidates of this type include black holes formed
at the epoch of the QCD phase transition, quark stars, and boson stars. Here we
show that accretion onto these objects produces substantial ionization in the
early universe, with an optical depth to Thomson scattering out to z=1100 of
approximately tau=2-4 [f_CO\epsilon_{-1}(M/Msun)]^{1/2} (H_0/65)^{-1}, where
\epsilon_{-1} is the accretion efficiency \epsilon\equiv L/{\dot M}c^2 divided
by 0.1 and f_CO is the fraction of matter in the compact objects. The current
upper limit to the scattering optical depth, based on the anisotropy of the

nonbaryonic dark matter.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003176v1
"The GLAST Large Area Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2006, is a next
generation space based gamma ray telescope which will improve in point source
sensitivity by a factor of 30 over that of EGRET below 10 GeV, and extend
beyond EGRET up to 300 GeV. Thus GLAST offers a unique opportunity to discover
WIMP dark matter through precision studies of gamma rays produced in pair
annihilations. The most dense region of dark matter in our galaxy is currently
thought to occur at the center; in particular, dark matter should concentrate
within 3 pc of the putative supermassive black hole located at the SgrA* radio
source. In fact, the 2nd and 3rd EGRET catalogs contain a significant point
source coincident with the Milky Way galactic center within a resolution of 12
arcminutes. The EGRET team has determined that the spectral and temporal
characteristics of this point source are consistent with dark matter WIMP
annihilations. More detailed analysis has determined that the magnitude and
spectrum of the EGRET source is consistent with relic WIMPs concentrated within
3 pc of the central supermassive black hole. Furthermore, the SgrA* radio
emission is consistent with the synchrotron radiation expected from electrons

mass microlensing event in the Galaxy by the MACHO group. We also look in more
detail at the light curves themselves, and make the case that many show the
characteristic morphology of caustic crossing events associated with a large
optical depth of lenses. This supports the idea that a large fraction of the
critical density is in the form of planetary mass compact bodies. The nature of

"Virial black-hole mass estimates are presented for 12698 quasars in the
redshift interval 0.1<z<2.1, based on modelling of spectra from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) first data release. The black-hole masses of the SDSS
quasars are found to lie between $\simeq10^{7}\Msun$ and an upper limit of
$\simeq 3\times 10^{9}\Msun$, entirely consistent with the largest black-hole
masses found to date in the local Universe. The estimated Eddington ratios of
the broad-line quasars (FWHM\geq 2000 kms^{-1}) show a clear upper boundary at
$L_{bol}/L_{Edd}\simeq 1$, suggesting that the Eddington luminosity is still a
relevant physical limit to the accretion rate of luminous broad-line quasars at
$z\leq 2$. By combining the black-hole mass distribution of the SDSS quasars
with the 2dF quasar luminosity function, the number density of active black
holes at $z\simeq 2$ is estimated as a function of mass. In addition, we
independently estimate the local black-hole mass function for early-types using
the $M_{bh}-\sigma$ and $M_{bh}-L_{bulge}$ correlations. Based on the SDSS
velocity dispersion function and the 2MASS $K-$band luminosity function, both
estimates are found to be consistent at the high-mass end ($M_{bh}\geq
10^{8}\Msun$). By comparing the estimated number density of active black holes

population of star-forming galaxies and the QSO luminosity function at z=3 can
be matched with the mass function of dark matter haloes predicted by
hierarchical cosmogonies for lifetimes of optically bright QSOs in the range
10^6 to 10^8 yr. We suggest that the mass of supermassive black holes may be
limited by the back-reaction of the emitted energy on the accretion flow in a
self-gravitating disc. This would imply a relation of black hole to halo mass
of the form M_bh ~(v_halo)^5 and a typical duration of the optically bright QSO
phase of a few times 10^7 yr. The high integrated mass density of black holes
inferred from recent black hole mass estimates in nearby galaxies may indicate
that the overall efficiency of supermassive black holes for producing blue
light is smaller than previously assumed. We discuss three possible accretion
modes with low optical emission efficiency: (i) accretion at far above the
Eddington rate, (ii) accretion obscured by dust, and (iii) accretion below the
critical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for a

dense star cluster evolution, or as part of the formation process of
super-massive black holes. Their cosmic mass density could exceed that of
super-massive black holes (Omega = 10^{-5.7}) and observations do not even rule
out that they may account for all of the baryonic dark matter in the Universe

"Gravitational lensing is a well known phenomenon predicted by the General
Theory of Relativity. It is now a well-developed observational technique in
astronomy and is considered to be a fundamental tool for acquiring information
about the nature and distribution of dark matter. In particular, gravitational
lensing experiments may be used to search for black holes. It has been proposed
that a Schwarzschild black hole may act as a retro-lens (Holz & Wheeler
\cite{hw}) which, if illuminated by a powerful light source (e.g. the Sun),
deflects light ray paths to large bending angles so that the light may reach
the observer. Here, by considering the strong field limit in the deflection
angle and confining our analysis to the black hole equatorial plane, we extend
the Holz-Wheeler results to slowly spinning Kerr black holes. By considering
the Holz-Wheeler geometrical configuration for the lens, source and observer we
find that the inclusion of rotation does not substantially change the
brightness of the retro-lensing images with respect to the Schwarzschild case.
We also discuss the possibility that the next generation space-based telescopes

parameter of the black hole.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401384v1
"Large dynamic range numerical simulations of atomic cooling driven collapse
of gas in pre-galactic DM haloes with T_vir ~ 10000 K show that the gas loses
90% and more of its angular momentum before rotational support sets in. In a
fraction of these haloes where the metallicity is low and UV radiation
suppresses H_2 cooling, conditions are thus very favourable for the rapid
build-up of massive black holes. Depending on the progression of metal
enrichment, the continued suppression of H_2 cooling by external and internal
UV radiation and the ability to trap the entropy produced by the release of
gravitational energy, the gas at the centre of the halo is expected to form a
supermassive star, a stellar-mass black hole accreting at super-Eddington
accretion rates or a compact star-cluster undergoing collisional run-away of
massive stars at its centre. In all three cases a massive black hole of
initially modest mass finds itself at the center of a rapid inflow of gas with
inflow rates of ~ 1 M_solar\yr. The massive black hole will thus grow quickly
to a mass of 10^5 to 10^6 M_solar until further inflow is halted either by
consumption of gas by star formation or by the increasing energy and momentum
feedback from the growing massive black hole. Conditions for the formation of
massive seed black holes in this way are most favourable in haloes with T_vir ~
15000 K and V_vir ~ 20 km\s with less massive haloes not allowing collapse of
gas by atomic cooling and more massive haloes being more prone to
fragmentation. This should imprint a characteristic mass on the mass spectrum

"Hawking has shown that if black holes were to exist in a universe that
expands forever, black holes would completely evaporate, violating unitarity. I
argue this means unitarity requires that the universe exist for only a finite
future proper time. I develop this argument, showing that unitarity also
requires the boundaries of all future sets to be Cauchy surfaces, and so no
event horizons can exist. Thus, the null generators of the surfaces of
astrophysical black holes must leave the surface in both time directions,
allowing non-spherical topologies for black hole surfaces. Since all
information eventually escapes astrophysical black holes, and since the null
surfaces defining astrophysical black holes are Cauchy surfaces, holography
automatically holds. I further show that unitarity requires the effective
cosmological constant to be zero eventually, since otherwise the universe would

"The relationships between supermassive black holes and the properties of
their associated dark-matter halos imply that outflows from accreting black
holes provide a feedback mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Accreting black
holes with weak or undetectable radio jets (radio-quiet quasars) outnumber
those with powerful jets (radio-loud quasars) by a factor ~10-100, so
powerful-jet outflows are often neglected. However, whenever powerful jets are
triggered, there is a dramatic (factor >100) step-function increase in the
efficiency of feedback. We use a feedback model, together with the measured
space density of flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars, to show that a powerful-jet
episode probably occurred in every protocluster in the Universe. Before jet
triggering, there was time for gravitational collapse to create many (~10-100)
surrounding protogalaxies massive enough to host radio-quiet quasars. After
triggering, the powerful jet pushes back and heats ionized gas so that it
cannot fall onto these protogalaxies and cool. Once neutral/molecular gas
reservoirs become exhausted, there is a synchronized shut down in both
star-formation and black-hole activity throughout the protocluster. These
considerations imply that radio-loud quasars have a profound influence on the
evolution of all the galaxies seen in clusters today.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409687v1

either higher Vc (or lower sigma) with respect to the HSB galaxies. This argues
against the relevance of baryon collapse in the radial density profile of the

equivalent to one between the mass of the dark matter halo and that of the

"This work considers the idea of massive black holes being the constituents of
the Galactic dark matter halo. It constrains the maximum black hole mass to
$\mbh \sil 5 \times 10^4 \msun$ by examining their influence on the population
of globular clusters in our Milky Way. In the adopted halo model, globular
clusters are exposed to constant bombardment of halo objects on their orbits
through the Galaxy and thus will steadily gain internal energy. Depending on
the mass of these halo objects and the structural parameters of the globular
clusters, they can be disrupted on time scales of a few billion years and
below. These disruption time scales are calculated using a modification of the
well known (classical) impulsive approximation and compared with direct N-body
simulations of such encounter events to ensure the method works correctly. For
a set of ten prototypical globular cluster models and black hole masses ranging
from $10^3$ to $10^7\:\msun$, Monte-Carlo-simulations of $10\,000$ encounter
histories over the period of 10 billion years were calculated each, at three

mass is present at these early times, then these rare supermassive black holes
will be located inside the most massive dark matter halos. These are therefore
ideal locations to search for the first clusters of galaxies. We use the
Lyman-break technique to identify star-forming galaxies at high redshifts. Our
observations show no overdensity of star-forming galaxies in the fields of
these quasars. The lack of (dust-free) luminous starburst companions indicates
that the quasars may be the only massive galaxies in their vicinity undergoing

used to determine virial black hole mass estimates.
  We compare our virial black hole mass estimates to dark matter halo masses

"We use three-dimensional high-resolution adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations
to investigate if mechanical feedback from active galactic nucleus jets can
halt a massive cooling flow in a galaxy cluster and give rise to a
self-regulated accretion cycle. We start with a 3 x 10^9MSun black hole at the
centre of a spherical halo with the mass of the Virgo cluster. Initially, all
the baryons are in a hot intracluster medium in hydrostatic equilibrium within
the dark matter's gravitational potential. The black hole accretes the
surrounding gas at the Bondi rate and a fraction of the accretion power is
returned into the intracluster medium mechanically through the production of
jets. The accretion, initially slow (~0.0002MSun/yr), becomes catastrophic, as
the gas cools and condenses in the dark matter's potential. Therefore, it
cannot prevent the cooling catastrophe at the centre of the cluster. However,
after this rapid phase, where the accretion rate reaches a peak of ~0.2MSun/yr,
the cavities inflated by the jets become highly turbulent. The turbulent mixing
of the shock-heated gas with the rest of the intracluster medium puts a quick
end to this short-lived rapid-growth phase. After dropping by almost two orders
of magnitudes, the black hole accretion rate stabilises at ~0.006MSun/yr,
without significant variations for several billions of years, indicating that a
self-regulated steady-state has been reached. This accretion rate corresponds
to a negligible increase of the black hole mass over the age of the Universe,
but is sufficient to create a quasi-equilibrium state in the cluster core.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0611914v2
"We present a simple scenario where the formation of galactic bulges was
regulated by the dark halo gravity and regulated the growth of the central
supermassive black hole. Assuming the angular momentum is low, we suggest that
bulges form in a runaway collapse due to the ""gravothermal"" instability once
the central gas density or pressure exceeds certain threshold (Xu & Zhao 2007).
We emphasize that the threshold is nearly universal, set by the background NFW
dark matter gravity $g_{DM} \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-8}{\rm cm} {\rm sec}^{-2}$ in
the central cusps of halos. Unlike known thresholds for gradual formation of
galaxy disks, we show that the universal ""halo-regulated"" star formation
threshold for spheroids matches the very high star formation rate and star
formation efficiency shown in high-redshift observations of central starburst
regions. The starburst feedback also builds up a pressure shortly after the
collapse. This large pressure could both act outward to halt further infall of
gas from larger scale, and act inward to counter the Compton-thick wind
launched from the central black hole in an Eddington accretion. Assuming the
feedback balancing inward and outward forces, our scenario naturally gives rise
to the black hole-bulge relationships observed in the local universe.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0701792v1

black holes loose memory of their initial orbital eccentricity if they
co-rotate with the gaseous disk. As a consequence the massive black holes form

average) much larger spins than black holes in spiral/disc galaxies. We study
how accretion from a warped disc influences the evolution of black hole spins

"Virial black-hole mass estimates are presented for 12698 quasars in the
redshift interval 0.1<z<2.1, based on modelling of spectra from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) first data release . The black-hole masses of the
SDSS quasars are found to lie between $\simeq10^{7}\Msun$ and an upper limit of
$\simeq 3\times 10^{9}\Msun$, entirely consistent with the largest black-hole
masses found to date in the local Universe. The estimated Eddington ratios of
the broad-line quasars (FWHM \geq2000 km s^{-1}) show a clear upper boundary at
L_{bol}/L_{Edd}~1, suggesting that the Eddington luminosity is still a relevant
physical limit to the accretion rate of luminous broad-line quasars at $z\leq
2$. By combining the black-hole mass distribution of the SDSS quasars with the
2dF quasar luminosity function, the number density of active black holes at
$z\simeq 2$ is estimated as a function of mass. By comparing the estimated
number density of active black holes at $z\simeq 2$ with the local mass density
of dormant black holes, we set lower limits on the quasar lifetimes and find

$\simeq 2$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405393v1
"The tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroids
in nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these two
components. Optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black
holes in the Universe and can account for >30% of the total cosmological
black-hole growth. As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star
formation and already host massive black holes [>10^(8) M(Sun)], there must
have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew [mass range
  ~10^(6)-10^(8) M(Sun)]. The likely signature of this earlier stage is
simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z>1; >8
billion light years away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray
observations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre
wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost
continuously throughout periods of intense star formation. This activity
appears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval
galaxy populations. We show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies is

"The first stars in the universe, forming at redshifts z>15 in minihalos with
masses of order 10^6 Msun, may leave behind black holes as their remnants.
These objects could conceivably serve as ""seeds"" for much larger black holes
observed at redshifts z~6. We study the growth of the remnant black holes
through accretion including for the first time the emitted accretion radiation
with adaptive mesh refinement cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations. The effects of photo-ionization and heating dramatically affect
the accretion flow from large scales, resulting in negligible mass growth of
the black hole. We compare cases with the accretion luminosity included and
neglected to show that the accretion radiation drastically changes the
environment within 100 pc of the black hole, where gas temperatures are
increased by an order of magnitude. The gas densities are reduced and further
star formation in the same minihalo prevented for the two hundred million years
of evolution we followed. These calculations show that even without the
radiative feedback included most seed black holes do not gain mass as
efficiently as has been hoped for in previous theories, implying that black
hole remnants of Pop III stars that formed in minihalos are not likely to be
the origin of miniquasars. Most importantly, however, these calculations
demonstrate that if early stellar mass black holes are indeed accreting close
to the Bondi-Hoyle rate with ten percent efficiency they have a dramatic local
effect in regulating star formation in the first galaxies.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.0820v2
"The tight correlation between the masses of central black holes and their
host spheroids in nearby galaxies and active galactic nuclei suggests that
black hole growth is closely related to their spheroid formation. Based on our
previous work regarding such a joint evolutionary scheme and the consequential
black hole to bulge mass correlation, we use the X-ray luminosity function of
AGN and the cosmological evolution rate which are from ROSAT X-ray surveys to
estimate the cosmic star formation history associated with the black hole
growth. By the Basic assumption that the major black hole growth occurs during
the luminous AGN phase, the luminosity function of AGNs as a function of
redshift traces not only the accretion history of the black holes but also the
cosmic star formation history of the spheroids.
  Although the space density of the especially luminous QSOs is very low, we
show that the total amount of star formation associated with the massive black
hole growth is almost the same as that of Lyman Break Galaxies detected by the
current optical deep surveys. We thus argue that the optical deep surveys may
miss about half of the net star formation in our Universe, This is probably due
to in part significant dust extinction as well as the small field of view of
previous optical surveys which cannot sample such rare events with relatively
short time scale. However, the far infrared emission from the dust heated by
star fomation on-going during the black hole growth could sufficiently account
for the observed SCUBA number counts, and would be the probable dominating
energy source of the SUBA population.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0212534v1
"The ubiquity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of nearby
luminous galaxies can arise from the multiple mergers experienced by dark
matter halos in hierarchical structure formation models, even if only a small
fraction of these galaxies harbor SMBHs at high redshifts. We illustrate this
possibility using cosmological Monte Carlo simulations of the merger history of
dark matter halos and their associated SMBHs. In our most extreme models, in
order to populate nearly every bright galaxy with a SMBH at z=0, only a few
percent of the halos with virial temperatures above 10^4 K are required to
harbor a SMBH at high redshift. This possibility must be included in studies of
the luminosity function and the clustering properties of quasars. We predict
the number of SMBH merger events that are detectable by the gravitational wave
experiment LISA, as a function of redshift, out to z=5. Although the event
rates can be significantly reduced in scenarios with rare SMBHs, a minimum of
\~10 detectable merger events per year is predicted if SMBH binaries coalesce
efficiently. The observed distribution of events with redshift could yield
valuable information on the SMBH formation process. If SMBH binaries do not
coalesce, we find that at least several SMBH slingshot ejections probably
occurred from z=5 to the present in each galaxy more massive than ~10^11 Msun
at z=0. Although our results are sensitive to the minimum cooling mass assumed
for the formation of SMBHs, we expect the qualitative predictions of our models
to be robust.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0101196v2

neutrinos. The spike luminosity depends on the density profile of the inner
halo: halos with finite cores have unnoticeable spikes, while halos with inner
cusps may have spikes so bright that the absence of a detected neutrino signal

"(Abridged) Using the number and sizes of observed gravitational lenses, I
derive upper limits on the dark matter content of elliptical galaxies. Galaxies
built from Cold Dark Matter (CDM) mass distributions are too concentrated to
comfortably satisfy these limits; SCDM is ruled out, and LCDM is only
marginally consistent with the data. Thus, lensing adds to the evidence that
CDM mass distributions are too concentrated on kiloparsec scales to agree with
real galaxies, and extends the argument to elliptical galaxies. By contrast,
the lack of central images in radio lenses implies that the central densities
of CDM galaxies are too low on ~10 parsec scales, even if supermassive black
holes are included. Self-interacting dark matter, or any other modification to
regular cold dark matter, must simultaneously reduce the densities on
kiloparsec scales and increase the densities on parsec scales in order to
satisfy the unique constraints from lensing.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0105200v2

an orbiting element of the Very Long Baseline Array. In an elliptical orbit
with an apogee height of 40,000-100,000 km, ARISE will provide resolution of 15
microarcseconds or better, 5-10 times better than that achievable on the
ground. At frequencies of 43 and 86 GHz, the resolution of light weeks to light
months in distant quasars will complement the gamma-ray and X-ray observations
of high-energy photons, which come from the same regions near the massive black
holes. At 22 GHz, ARISE will image the water maser disks in active galaxies
more than 15 Mpc from Earth, probing accretion physics and giving accurate
measurements of black-hole masses. ARISE also will study gravitational lenses
at resolutions of tens of microarcseconds, yielding important information on
the dark-matter distribution and on the possible existence of compact objects
with masses of 10^3 to 10^6 solar masses.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9901374v1
"The observed number counts of quasars may be explained either by long-lived
activity within rare massive hosts, or by short-lived activity within smaller,
more common hosts. It has been argued that quasar lifetimes may therefore be
inferred from their clustering length, which determines the typical mass of the
quasar host. Here we point out that the relationship between the mass of the
black-hole and the circular velocity of its host dark-matter halo is more
fundamental to the determination of the clustering length. In particular, the
clustering length observed in the 2dF quasar redshift survey is consistent with
the galactic halo - black-hole relation observed in local galaxies, provided
that quasars shine at ~10-100% of their Eddington luminosity. The slow
evolution of the clustering length with redshift inferred in the 2dF quasar
survey favors a black-hole mass whose redshift-independent scaling is with halo
circular velocity, rather than halo mass. These results are independent from
observations of the number counts of bright quasars which may be used to
determine the quasar lifetime and its dependence on redshift. We show that if
quasar activity results from galaxy mergers, then the number counts of quasars
imply an episodic quasar lifetime that is set by the dynamical time of the host
galaxy rather than by the Salpeter time. Our results imply that as the redshift
increases, the central black-holes comprise a larger fraction of their host
galaxy mass and the quasar lifetime gets shorter.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0403714v1
"After being destroyed by a binary supermassive black hole, a stellar density
cusp can regrow at the center of a galaxy via energy exchange between stars
moving in the gravitational field of the single, coalesced hole. We illustrate
this process via high-accuracy N-body simulations. Regeneration requires
roughly one relaxation time and the new cusp extends to a distance of roughly
one-fifth the black hole's influence radius, with density rho ~ r^{-7/4}; the
mass in the cusp is of order 10% the mass of the black hole. Growth of the cusp
is preceded by a stage in which the stellar velocity dispersion evolves toward
isotropy and away from the tangentially-anisotropic state induced by the
binary. We show that density profiles similar to those observed at the center
of the Milky Way and M32 can regenerate themselves in several Gyr following
infall of a second black hole; the presence of density cusps at the centers of
these galaxies can therefore not be used to infer that no merger has occurred.
We argue that Bahcall-Wolf cusps are ubiquitous in stellar spheroids fainter
than M_V ~ -18.5 that contain supermassive black holes, but the cusps have not
been detected outside of the Local Group since their angular sizes are less
than 0.1"". We show that the presence of a cusp implies a lower limit of
\~10^{-4} per year on the rate of stellar tidal disruptions, and discuss the
consequences of the cusps for gravitational lensing and the distribution of
dark matter on sub-parsec scales.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510498v4

"The structure of dark matter halos as predicted from cosmological models is
discussed and compared with observed rotation curves of dark matter-dominated
dwarf galaxies. The theoretical models predict that dark matter halos represent
a one-parameter family with a universal density profile. Observations of dark
matter-dominated rotation curves indeed confirm the universal structure of dark
halos. They are even in excellent agreement with the expected mass-radius
scaling relations for the currently favoured cosmological model (standard cold
dark matter with Omega_0=0.25 and Omega_{Lambda}=0.75). The rotation profiles
however disagree with the predicted dark matter density distributions. Secular
processes which might affect the inner halo structure do not seem to provide a
good solution to this problem. We discuss, as an alternative, the possibility
that dark halos consist of two separate components, a dark baryonic and a dark
non-baryonic component.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9904159v1
"We investigate contributions to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB)
due to neutralino dark matter (DM) pair-annihilation into photons, from DM
density enhancements (minispikes) surrounding intermediate-mass black holes
(IMBHs). We focus on two IMBH formation scenarios; our conservative scenario
where IMBHs are remnants of Population-III stars, and our optimistic scenario
here IMBHs are formed in protogalactic disks. In both scenarios, their
formation in pregalactic halos at high redshift lead to the formation of
minispikes that are bright sources of gamma-ray photons. Taking into account
minispike depletion processes, we only sum contributions from a cosmological
distribution of IMBHs with maintained minispikes. Our conservative scenario (BH
mass 10^2 M_sun with a r^{-3/2} minispike) predicts gamma-ray fluxes that are
an order larger than the equivalent flux, using the same DM parameters (mass
100 GeV and annihilation cross-section 3 \times 10^{-26} cm^3 s^{-1}, from the
host halo without IMBH minispikes. Our optimistic scenario (BH mass 10^5 M_sun
with a r^{-7/3} minispike) predicts fluxes that are three orders larger, that
can reach current EGB observations taken by EGRET (DM parameters as above).
This fact may serve interesting consequences for constraining DM parameters and
elucidating the true nature of IMBHs. Additionally, we determine the spectra of
DM annihilation into monochromatic gamma-rays, and show that its flux can be
within observational range of GLAST, providing a potential `smoking-gun'
signature of DM.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0607042v2
"Quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes, but the
problem of the duty cycle related to the episodic activity of the black holes
remains open as one of the major questions of cosmological evolution of
quasars. In this Letter, we obtain quasar duty cycles based on analyses of a
large sample composed of 10,979 quasars with redshifts $z\le2.1$ from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release Three. We estimate masses of quasar
black holes and obtain their mass function (MF) of the present sample. We then
get the duty cycle $\bar{\delta}(z)=10^{-3}\sim 1$ based on the So{\l}tan's
argument, implying that black holes are undergoing multiple episodic activity.
We find that the duty cycle has a strong evolution. By comparison, we show that
evolution of the duty cycle follows the history of cosmic star formation rate
(SFR) density in the Universe, providing intriguing evidence for a natural
connection between star formation and triggering of black hole activity.
Feedback on star formation from black hole activity is briefly discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606704v1
"We estimate the energy release of black hole formation to the intra-cluster
medium of the Coma cluster and find that this is comparable to the present day
energy content. Therefore an energetic and maybe hydrostatic influence is
possible. Our calculations rely on the assumption of an universal black hole to
galaxy mass ratio (more exactly: spheroidal mass component of the stellar
population), for which there is growing evidence. On a cosmological scale,
there is also an energy release of black hole formation comparable to what is
expected to be present within the thermal gas, caused by the process of
structure formation. This indicates an important dynamical influence, neglected
by present day structure formation simulations. This estimate of cosmological
black hole energy release is independent of the black hole to galaxy mass
ratio, but consistent with its value.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9803105v1
"We investigate the characteristic radiative efficiency \epsilon, Eddington
ratio \lambda, and duty cycle P_0 of high-redshift active galactic nuclei
(AGN), drawing on measurements of the AGN luminosity function at z=3-6 and,
especially, on recent measurements of quasar clustering at z=3-4.5 from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The free parameters of our models are \epsilon,
\lambda, and the normalization, scatter, and redshift evolution of the relation
between black hole mass \mbh and halo virial velocity V_vir. We compute the
luminosity function from the implied growth of the black hole mass function and
the quasar correlation length from the bias of the host halos. We test our
adopted formulae for the halo mass function and halo bias against measurements
from the large N-body simulation developed by the MICE collaboration. The
strong clustering of AGNs observed at z=3 and, especially, at z=4 implies that
massive black holes reside in rare, massive dark matter halos. Reproducing the
observed luminosity function then requires high efficiency \epsilon and/or low
Eddington ratio \lambda, with a lower limit (based on 2\sigma agreement with
the measured z=4 correlation length) \epsilon> 0.7\lambda/(1+0.7\lambda),
implying \epsilon > 0.17 for \lambda > 0.25. Successful models predict high
duty cycles, P_0~0.2, 0.5, and 0.9 at z=3.1, 4.5 and 6, respectively, and they
require that the fraction of halo baryons locked in the central black hole is
much larger than the locally observed value. The rapid drop in the abundance of
the massive and rare host halos at z>7 implies a proportionally rapid decline
in the number density of luminous quasars, much stronger than simple
extrapolations of the z=3-6 luminosity function would predict. (abridged)",http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4919v2

"Braneworld gravity is a model that endows physical space with an extra
dimension. In the type II Randall-Sundrum braneworld gravity model, the extra
dimension modifies the spacetime geometry around black holes, and changes
predictions for the formation and survival of primordial black holes. We
develop a comprehensive analytical formalism for far-field black hole lensing
in this model, using invariant quantities to compute all geometric optics
lensing observables. We then make the first analysis of wave optics in
braneworld lensing, working in the semi-classical limit. We show that wave
optics offers the only realistic way to observe braneworld effects in black
hole lensing. We point out that if primordial braneworld black holes exist,
have mass M, and contribute a fraction f of the dark matter, then roughly 3e5 x
f (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) of them lie within our Solar System. These objects, which
we call ""attolenses,"" would produce interference fringes in the energy spectra
of gamma-ray bursts at energies ~100 (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) MeV (which will soon
be accessible with the GLAST satellite). Primordial braneworld black holes
spread throughout the universe could produce similar interference effects; the
probability for ""attolensing"" may be non-negligible. If interference fringes
were observed, the fringe spacing would yield a simple upper limit on M.
Detection of a primordial black hole with M <~ 1e-19 Msun would challenge
general relativity and favor the braneworld model. Further work on lensing
tests of braneworld gravity must proceed into the physical optics regime, which
awaits a description of the full spacetime geometry around braneworld black
holes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0603061v3

proposed possibility to produce planck relics in 4-dimensional string gravity
is considered. Possible experimental detection through gravitational waves is
further explored. We stress that inflation with a low energy scale, and also

"Cosmic ray antiprotons can originate from dark matter annihilating into
quarks that subsequently decay into antiprotons. Evaporation of primordial

look for excess antiprotons as a signature of these exotic antiproton sources.
However, in the vicinity of the Earth low energy particles are strongly
modulated by the solar wind, which makes any analysis ambiguous. The adverse
effects of the solar wind can be avoided by placing a low energy antiproton
spectrometer aboard an interstellar probe. The theoretical predictions are

non-zero initial thermal velocities. We present a mathematical treatment of

"Gravitational tunneling radiation (GTR) from a black hole is similar to
electric field emission of electrons from a metal. There is always a second
body to give the gravitational barrier of a black hole a finite rather than
infinite width so that a particle can escape by tunneling. Thus GTR may be
emitted from black holes in a process differing from that of Hawking radiation
(HR) with broad ranging astrophysical ramifications. HR of an ""isolated"" black
hole is an abstraction which has not been detected in three decades, and which
may not exist. GTR is beamed, in contrast to HR, which is isotropic. Little
black holes may account for much of the dark matter of the universe, and hence
the anomalous rotation of spiral galaxies, as well as contribute to the
accelerated expansion of the universe. The absence of HR permits the existence
of little black hole gravitationally bound atoms with quantized orbits and
quantized gravitational radiation. Since some theories speculate that the early
universe may have existed in n-dimensional space, certain results will be
presented both for general n-space and for the 3-space in which we live. An
inconsistency between quantum mechanics and the equivalence principle is
demonstrated. It is shown that angular momentum cannot be quantized in the
usual manner in 4-space, with possible consequences for Kaluza-Klein theory. An
hypothesis is presented for reducing the enormously too-large vacuum zero-point
energy. String theory may be impacted by the finding that atoms are not
energetically stable in higher than 3-space. GTR avoids the black hole lost
information paradox.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302469v4
"We discuss the link between dark matter halos hosting the first PopIII stars
and the rare, massive, halos that are generally considered to host bright
quasars at high redshift z~6. The main question that we intend to answer is
whether the super-massive black holes powering these QSOs grew out from the
seeds planted by the first intermediate massive black holes created in the
universe. This question involves a dynamical range of 10^13 in mass and we
address it by combining N-body simulations of structure formation to identify
the most massive halos at z~6 with a Monte Carlo method based on linear theory
to obtain the location and formation times of the first light halos within the
whole simulation box. We show that the descendants of the first ~10^6 Msun
virialized halos do not, on average, end up in the most massive halos at z~6,
but rather live in a large variety of environments. The oldest PopIII
progenitors of the most massive halos at z~6, form instead from density peaks
that are on average one and a half standard deviations more common than the
first PopIII star formed in the volume occupied by one bright high-z QSO. The
intermediate mass black hole seeds planted by the very first PopIII stars at
z>40 can easily grow to masses m_BH>10^9.5 Msun by z=6 assuming Eddington
accretion with radiative efficiency \epsilon~0.1. Quenching of the black hole
accretion is therefore crucial to avoid an overabundance of supermassive black
holes at lower redshift. This can be obtained if the mass accretion is limited
to a fraction \eta~6*10^{-3} of the total baryon mass of the halo hosting the
black hole. The resulting high end slope of the black hole mass function at z=6

"We study the generation of a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background
produced from a population of core-collapse supernovae, which form black holes

could generate a stochastic GW background with a maximum amplitude of $h_{\rm
BG} \simeq 10^{-24}$ and corresponding closure energy density of
$\Omega_{\rm{GW}}\sim 10^{-7}$, in the frequency band $\nu_{\rm{obs}} \simeq

"Spherical gravitational collapse of a cold gas of annihilating particles
involves a competition between the free-fall rate $\propto\sqrt{\rho}$ and the
(s-wave) annihilation rate $\propto\rho$. Thus, there is a critical density
$\rhoann$ above which annihilation proceeds faster than free fall.
Gravitational collapse of a cloud of (initial) mass $M$ to a black hole is only
possible if $3/32\pi G^3M^2\lesssim\rhoann$, or $M\gtrsim\Mann\equiv (3/32\pi
G^3\rhoann)^{1/2}$. For a particle mass $m$ and freeze-out temperature

released in a burst lasting a time $\sim GM_{BH}$ that could reach a total
annihilation luminosity $\sim 10^{59} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. The absence of
astronomical observations of such spectacular events suggests either: (i) the
branching ratio for CDM annihilation to $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs or quarks $\lesssim
10^{-10}$, while the branching ratio to $\nu{\bar{\nu}}$ is $\lesssim 10^{-5}$;

"We discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated
feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of
structure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmic
population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Our model assumes that seed
black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming halos.
We then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black
holes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we
distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole
accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be
in a `quasar regime', where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a
small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. For black
holes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback
occurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous
environment. Using our new model, we carry out TreeSPH cosmological simulations
on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both
for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model
produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad
agreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes
significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their
star formation history, their amount of cold gas, and their colours. Also, the
properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive
black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicity
and entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows. [Abridged]",http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2238v2
"A long-standing question is whether active galactic nuclei (AGN) vary like
Galactic black hole systems when appropriately scaled up by mass (refs 1-3). If
so, we can then determine how AGN should behave on cosmological timescales by
studying the brighter and much faster varying Galactic systems. As X-ray
emission is produced very close to the black holes, it provides one of the best
diagnostics of their behaviour. A characteristic timescale, which potentially
could tell us about the mass of the black hole, is found in the X-ray
variations from both AGN and Galactic black holes (refs 1-6), but whether it is
physically meaningful to compare the two has been questioned (ref 7). Here we
report that, after correcting for variations in the accretion rate, the
timescales can be physically linked, revealing that the accretion process is
exactly the same for small and large black holes. Strong support for this
linkage comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the permitted optical emission lines
in AGN whose widths (in both broad-line AGN and narrow-emission-line Seyfert 1
galaxies) correlate strongly with the characteristic X-ray timescale, exactly
as expected from the AGN black hole masses and accretion rates. So AGN really
are just scaled-up Galactic black holes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612273v1
"The standard cold dark matter (CDM) model has recently been challenged by the
claim that dwarf galaxies have dark matter halos with constant density cores.
Consequently, numerous alternative dark matter candidates have recently been
proposed. In this paper, we scrutinize the observational evidence for the
incongruity between dwarf galaxies and the CDM model. To this end, we analyze
the rotation curves of 20 late-type dwarf galaxies studied by Swaters (1999).
Taking the effects of beam-smearing and adiabatic contraction into account, we
fit mass models to these rotation curves with dark matter halos with different
cusp slopes, ranging from constant density cores to r^{-2} cusps. Uncertainties
in the stellar mass-to-light ratio and the limited spatial sampling of the
halo's density distribution hamper a unique mass decomposition. Consequently,
the rotation curves in our sample cannot be used to discriminate between dark
halos with constant density cores and r^{-1} cusps. We show that the dwarf
galaxies analyzed here are consistent with cold dark matter halos in a LCDM
cosmology, and that there is thus no need to abandon the idea that dark matter
is cold and collisionless. However, the data is also consistent with any
alternative dark matter model that produces dark matter halos with central
cusps less steep than r^{-1.5}. In fact, we argue that based on existing
rotation curves alone at best weak limits can be obtained on cosmological
parameters and/or the nature of the dark matter.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0006048v2

"Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto a galactic center with a
high-resolution $N$-body/SPH simulation, we investigate the formation of an
intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) during the hierarchical formation of a
small spiral galaxy (with a total mass of $10^{10}M_{\odot}$) in the high-$z$
universe. We found that the rate of average mass accretion to the nucleus due
to the radiation drag exerted by newly formed stars in the forming galaxy is
$\approx 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. As a result of this accretion, an IMBH
with $\approx 10^{4}M_{\odot}$ can be formed in the center of the spiral galaxy
at $z\sim 4$. We found that a central BH coevolves with the dark matter halo
from $z\sim 15$ to $z\sim 2$. The mass ratio of the BH to the dark matter halo
is nearly constant $\approx (1-3) \times 10^{-6}$ from $z\sim 10$ to $z\sim 2$.
This is because that change in the dark matter potential enhances star
formation in the central part of the galaxy, and as a result the BH evolves due
to mass accretion via the radiation drag. Therefore, our model naturally
predicts a correlation between massive BHs and dark matter halos. Moreover, it
is found that the final BH-to-bulge mass ratio ($\approx 5\times 10^{-5}$) in a
small spiral galaxy at high-$z$ is much smaller than that in the large galaxies
($\approx 10^{-3}$). Our results also suggest that the scatter in the observed
scaling relations between the bulge mass and black hole mass are caused by a
time lag between BH growth and growth of bulge. We also predict that the X-ray
luminosity of AGN is positively correlated with the CO luminosity in the
central region. By comparing our results with the properties of Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs), it is predicted that some LBGs have massive BHs of $\approx
10^{6}-10^{7}M_{\odot}$.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504202v1

measurements of the positions or radial velocities of S0-1 and S0-2, which
could be orbiting within such a fermion ball, may reduce this allowed phase
space and eventually rule out one of the currently acceptable scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207424v1
"After a discussion of the properties of degenerate fermion balls, we analyze
the orbits of the stars S0-1 and S0-2, which have the smallest projected
distances to Sgr A*, in the supermassive black hole as well as in the fermion
ball scenarios of the Galactic center. It is shown that both scenarios are
consistent with the data, as measured during the last six years by Genzel et
al. and Ghez et al. The free parameters of the projected orbit of a star are
the unknown components of its velocity v_z and distance z to Sgr A* in 1995.4,
with the z-axis being in the line of sight. We show, in the case of S0-1 and
S0-2, that the z-v_z phase-space which fits the data, is much larger for the
fermion ball than for the black hole scenario. Future measurements of the
positions or radial velocities of S0-1 and S0-2 could reduce this allowed
phase-space and eventually rule out one of the currently acceptable scenarios.

object, or dark matter in general at the center of our Galaxy.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103466v1
"We investigate the hypothesis that the cores of elliptical galaxies and
bulges are created from the binding energy liberated by the coalescence of
supermassive binary black holes during galaxy mergers. Assuming that the
central density profiles of galaxies were initially steep power laws, we define
the ``mass deficit'' as the mass in stars that had to be removed from the
nucleus in order to produce the observed core. We use nonparametric
deprojection to compute the mass deficit in a sample of 35 early-type galaxies
with high-resolution imaging data. We find that the mass deficit correlates
well with the mass of the nuclear black hole, consistent with the predictions
of merger models. We argue that core sizes in halos of non-interacting dark
matter particles should be comparable to those observed in the stars.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0110185v3
"We present a physical model for the coevolution of massive spheroidal
galaxies and active nuclei at their centers. Supernova heating is increasingly
effective in slowing down the star formation and in driving gas outflows in
smaller and smaller dark matter halos. Thus the more massive protogalaxies
virializing at early times are the sites of faster star formation. The
correspondingly higher radiation drag causes a faster angular momentum loss by
the gas and induces a larger accretion rate onto the central black hole. In
turn, the kinetic energy of the outflows powered by the active nuclei can
unbind the residual gas in a time shorter for larger halos. The model accounts
for a broad variety of dynamical, photometric and metallicity properties of
early-type galaxies, for the M_BH -- \sigma relation and for the local
supermassive black-hole mass function.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0409585v1

coalescence are prime candidates for detection by the satellite LISA. We use

estimates for the SMBH--dark matter halo mass relation and SMBH occupation
fraction to estimate the maximum coalescence rate for major SMBH mergers.
Assuming efficient binary coalescence, and guided by the lowest nuclear black
hole mass inferred in local galactic bulges and nearby low-luminosity active
galactic nuclei (10^5 Msun) we predict approximately 15 detections per year at
a signal to noise greater than five, in each of the inspiral and ringdown

will be more readily detected via gravitational waves from the ringdown phase.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0503210v1
"Nearby masses can have a high probability of lensing stars in a distant
background field. High-probability lensing, or mesolensing, can therefore be
used to dramatically increase our knowledge of dark and dim objects in the
solar neighborhood, where it can discover and study members of the local dark
population (free-floating planets, low-mass dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron
stars, and stellar mass black holes). We can measure the mass and transverse
velocity of those objects discovered (or already known), and determine whether
or not they are in binaries with dim companions. We explore these and other
applications of mesolensing, including the study of forms of matter that have
been hypothesized but not discovered, such as intermediate-mass black holes,
dark matter objects free-streaming through the Galactic disk, and planets in
the outermost regions of the solar system. In each case we discuss the
feasibility of deriving results based on present-day monitoring systems, and
also consider the vistas that will open with the advent of all-sky monitoring

CDM particle is the neutralino, we find that collisional damping during its
kinetic decoupling from the radiation fluid and free streaming introduce a
small-scale cut-off in the primordial power spectrum of CDM. This cut-off sets
the scale for the very first CDM objects in the Universe, which we expect to
have a mass of $\sim 10^{-12} M_\odot$. For non-thermal CDM candidates, such as
axions, wimpzillas, or primordial black holes, the cosmological QCD transition

structures in cosmology. By treating the baryons as a viscous gas, we find that
both spheres and disks are possible solutions. We find analytically that the
density profiles have inner and outer solutions, which in general are
different. For disks we identify a central core, with density profile rho_d =
constant, and the outer profile rho_d ~ r^{-3}. For spherical structures we
find the profile rho_s ~ r^{-6}. In the presence of a dominating central black
hole we find the inner profile rho ~ r^{-3/2}. When the mass is dominated by a
dark matter component then the baryonic density profile will depend on the dark
matter profile, and we point out how one can use this connection to infer the
DM profile directly by observing the baryonic density profile.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303416v2
"A model of inhomogeneous baryogenesis based on the Affleck and Dine mechanism
is described. A simple coupling of the scalar baryon field to the inflaton
allows for formation of astronomically significant bubbles with a large baryon
(or antibaryon) asymmetry. During the farther evolution these domains form
compact stellar-like objects, or lower density clouds, or primordial black
holes of different size. According to the scenario, such high baryonic number
objects occupy relatively small fraction of space but despite that they may
significantly contribute to the cosmological mass density. For some values of
parameters the model allows the possibility the whole dark matter in the
universe to be baryonic. Furthermore, the model allows the existence of the
antibaryonic B-bubbles, i.e. a significant fraction of the mass density in the
universe can be in the form of the compact antimatter objects (e.g.
anti-stars).",http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2986v2

on the evolution of a black holes binary in presence of dark matter, focusing
on the energy transfer between binary and dark matter induced by dynamical
friction. Finally, I present the prospects for studying dark matter with
gravitational wave observations, and argue that future interferometers might be
able to detect and characterise dark matter overdensities around black holes.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11513v1
"We have developed a consistent analytical model to describe the observed
evolution of the quasar luminosity function. Our model combines black hole mass
distributions based on the Press - Schechter theory of the structure formation
in the Universe with quasar luminosity functions resulting from a physics-based
emission model that takes into account the time-dependent phenomena occurring
in the accretion disks. Quasar evolution and CDM models are mutually
constraining, therefore our model gives an estimation of the exponent, n, of
the power spectrum, P(k), which is found to be -1.8 < n < -1.6. We were able to
reject a generally assumed hypothesis of a constant ratio between Dark Matter
Halo and the Black Hole mass, since the observed data could not be fitted under
this assumption. We found that the relation between the Dark Matter Halos and
Black Hole masses is better described by M_{BH}=M_{DMH}^{0.668}. This model
provides a reasonable fit to the observed quasar luminosity function at
redshifts higher than ~2.0. We suggest that the disagreement at lower redshift
is due to mergers. Based on the agreement at high redshift, we estimated the
merger rate at lower redshift, and argue that this rate should depend on the
redshift, like (1+z)^3.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009105v1

at using the dynamics of the subhalos as a probe of the respective cosmology.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1851v2
"We investigate the cosmological effects of a neutrino interaction with cold
dark matter. We postulate a neutrino that interacts with a ``neutrino
interacting dark matter'' (NIDM) particle with an elastic-scattering cross
section that either decreases with temperature as $T^2$ or remains constant
with temperature. The neutrino--dark-matter interaction results in a
neutrino--dark-matter fluid with pressure, and this pressure results in
diffusion-damped oscillations in the matter power spectrum, analogous to the
acoustic oscillations in the baryon-photon fluid. We discuss the bounds from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on the NIDM opacity (ratio of cross section to
NIDM-particle mass) and compare with the constraint from observation of
neutrinos from supernova 1987A. If only a fraction of the dark matter interacts
with neutrinos, then NIDM oscillations may affect current cosmological
constraints from measurements of galaxy clustering. We discuss how detection of
NIDM oscillations would suggest a particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the
dark-matter sector.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0606190v1
"The annihilation of neutralino dark matter in the Galactic Center (GC) may
result in radio signals that can be used to detect or constrain the dark matter
halo density profile or dark matter particle properties. At the Galactic
Center, the accretion flow onto the central Black Hole (BH) sustains strong
magnetic fields that can induce synchrotron emission by electrons and positrons
generated in neutralino annihilations during advection onto the BH. Here we
reanalyze the radiative processes relevant for the neutralino annihilation
signal at the GC, with realistic assumptions about the accretion flow and its
magnetic properties. We find that neglecting these effects, as done in previous
papers, leads to the incorrent electron and photon spectra. We find that the
magnetic fields associated with the flow are significantly stronger than
previously estimated. We derive the appropriate equilibrium distribution of
electrons and positron and the resulting radiation, considering adiabatic
compression in the accretion flow, inverse Compton scattering off synchrotron
photons (synchrotron self-Compton scattering), and synchrotron self-absorption
of the emitted radiation. We derive the signal for a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
dark matter halo profile and a NFW profile with a dark matter spike due to the
central BH. We find that the observed radio emission from the GC is
inconsistent with the scenario in which a spiky distribution of neutralinos is
present. We discuss several important differences between our calculations and
those previously presented in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402588v2
"This work develops and explores a quantum-based theory which enables the
nature and origin of cold dark matter (CDM) to be understood without need to
introduce exotic particles. The quantum approach predicts the existence of
certain macroscopic quantum structures that are WIMP-like even when occupied by
traditional baryonic particles. These structures function as dark matter
candidates for CDM theory on large scales where it has been most successful,
and retain the potential to yield observationally compliant predictions on
galactic cluster and sub-cluster scales. Relatively pure, high angular
momentum, eigenstate solutions obtained from Schrodinger's equation in weak
gravity form the structural basis. They have no classical analogue, and
properties radically different from those of traditional localised matter
(whose eigenstate spectra contain negligible quantities of such states).
Salient features include radiative lifetimes that can exceed the age of the
universe, energies and 'sizes' consistent with galactic halos, and negligible
interaction rates with radiation and macroscopic galactic objects. This
facilitates the formation of sparsely populated macroscopic quantum structures
that are invisible and stable. Viable structure formation scenarios are based
on the seed potential wells of primordial black holes formed at the e+/e- phase
transition. The structures can potentially produce suitable internal density
distributions and have capacity to accommodate the required amount of halo dark
matter. The formation scenarios show that it is possible to incorporate
structures into universal evolutionary scenarios without significantly
compromising the results of WMAP or the measurements of elemental BBN ratios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0406139v1
"Observations by the MACHO collaboration indicate that a significant fraction
of the galactic halo dark matter may be in form of compact objects with masses
$M\sim 0.5M_{\odot}$. Identification of these objects as red or white dwarfs is
problematic due to stringent observational upper limits on such dwarf
populations. Primordial black hole (PBH) formation from pre-existing density
fluctuations is facilitated during the cosmic QCD transition due to a
significant decrease in pressure forces. For generic initial density
perturbation spectra this implies that essentially all PBHs may form with
masses close to the QCD-horizon scale, $M_h^{QCD}\sim 1M_{\odot}$. It is
possible that such QCD PBHs contribute significantly to the closure density
today. I discuss the status of theoretical predictions for the properties of
QCD PBH dark matter. Observational signatures of and constraints on a cosmic
solar mass PBH population are also discussed.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805147v1

"Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models have recently been resurrected to resolve
apparent conflicts of Cold Dark Matter (DM) models with observations. Endowing
the DM particles with non-negligible velocities causes free-streaming, which
suppresses the primordial power spectrum on small scales. The choice of a
root-mean-square velocity dispersion v(rms) = 0.05 km/s at redshift z=0
(corresponding to a particle mass of 1 keV if the WDM particles are fermions
decoupling while relativistic) helps alleviate most, but probably not all, of
the small-scale problems faced by CDM. An important side-effect of the particle
velocities is the severe decrease in the number of collapsed halos at high
redshift. This is caused both by the loss of small-scale power, and by the
delay in the collapse of the smallest individual halos (with masses near the
effective Jeans mass of the DM). The presence of early halos is required in
order (1) to host either early quasars or galaxies that can reionize the
universe by redshift z=5.8, and (2) to allow the growth of the supermassive
black hole believed to power the recently discovered quasar SDSS 1044-1215 at
this redshift. We quantify these constraints using a modified Press-Schechter
formalism, and find v(rms) < 0.04 km/s (or m_X > 1 keV). If future observations
uncover massive black holes at z > 10, or reveal that reionization occurred at
z > 10, this could conclusively rule out WDM models as the solution to the
small-scale crisis of the CDM paradigm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0103050v1
"We investigate the relationship between the mass and velocity fields of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) and dark matter. Although the evolution of the IGM
is dynamically governed by the gravity of the underlying dark matter field,
some statistical properties of the IGM inevitably decouple from those of the
dark matter once the nonlinearity of the dynamical equations and the stochastic
nature of the field is considered. With simulation samples produced by a hybrid
cosmological hydrodynamic/N-body code, which is effective in capturing shocks
and complicated structures with high precision, we find that the one-point
distributions of the IGM field are systematically different from that of dark
matter as follows: 1.) the one-point distribution of the IGM peculiar velocity
field is exponential at least at redshifts less than 2, while the dark matter
velocity field is close to a Gaussian field; 2.) although the one-point
distributions of the IGM and dark matter are similar, the point-by-point
correlation between the IGM and dark matter density fields significantly
differs on all scales and redshifts analyzed; 3.) the one-point density
distributions of the difference between IGM and dark matter fields are highly
non-Gaussian and long tailed. These discrepancies violate the similarity
between the IGM and dark matter and cannot be explained simply as Jeans
smoothing of the IGM. However, these statistical discrepancies are consistent
with the fluids described by stochastic-force driven nonlinear dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405508v1
"Cold Dark Matter (CDM) has become the standard modern theory of cosmological
structure formation. Its predictions appear to be in good agreement with data
on large scales, and it naturally accounts for many properties of galaxies. But
despite its many successes, there has been concern about CDM on small scales
because of the possible contradiction between the linearly rising rotation
curves observed in some dark-matter-dominated galaxies vs. the $1/r$ density
cusps at the centers of simulated CDM halos. Other CDM issues on small scales
include the very large number of small satellite halos in simulations, far more
than the number of small galaxies observed locally, and problems concerning the
angular momentum of the baryons in dark matter halos. The latest data and
simulations have lessened, although not entirely resolved, these concerns.
Meanwhile, the main alternatives to CDM that have been considered to solve
these problems, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and warm dark matter (WDM),

place constraints on cosmological models. We show that such constraints may be
severely modified if the value of the gravitational ""constant"" G varies with
cosmological epoch, a possibility which arises in many scenarios for the early
Universe. The nature of the modification depends upon whether the value of G
near a black hole maintains the value it had at its formation epoch
(corresponding to gravitational memory) or whether it tracks the background
cosmological value. This is still uncertain but we discuss various approaches
which might help to resolve the issue.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0003027v1
"The formation of quasar black holes during the hydrodynamic collapse of
protogalactic gas clouds is discussed. The dissipational collapse and long-
term dynamical evolution of these systems is analysed using three-dimensional
numerical simulations. The calculations focus on the final collapse stages of
the inner baryonic component and therefore ignore the presence of dark matter.
Two types of initial conditions are considered: uniformly rotating spherical
clouds, and irrotational ellipsoidal clouds. In both cases the clouds are
initially cold, homogeneous, and not far from rotational support ($T/|W|
\approx 0.1$). Although the details of the dynamical evolution depend
sensitively on the initial conditions, the qualitative features of the final
configurations do not. Most of the gas is found to fragment into small dense
clumps, that eventually make up a spheroidal component resembling a galactic
bulge. About 5\% of the initial mass remains in the form of a smooth disk of
gas supported by rotation in the gravitational potential well of the outer
spheroid. If a central seed black hole of mass $\gsim10^6M_\odot$ forms, it can
grow by steady accretion from the disk and reach a typical quasar black hole
mass $\sim10^8M_\odot$ in less than $5\times 10^8\,$yr. In the absence of a
sufficiently massive seed, dynamical instabilities in a strongly self-
gravitating inner region of the disk will inhibit steady accretion of gas and
may prevent the immediate formation of a quasar.",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9401026v1
"We study the imprints of AGN feedback and physical viscosity on the
properties of galaxy clusters using hydrodynamical simulation models carried
out with the TreeSPH code GADGET-2. Besides self-gravity of dark matter and
baryons, our approach includes radiative cooling and heating processes of the
gas component and a multiphase model for star formation and SNe feedback.
Additionally, we introduce a prescription for physical viscosity in GADGET-2,
based on a SPH discretization of the Navier-Stokes and general heat transfer
equations. Adopting the Braginskii parameterization for the shear viscosity
coefficient, we explore how gas viscosity influences the properties of
AGN-driven bubbles. We also introduce a novel, self-consistent AGN feedback
model where we simultaneously follow the growth and energy release of massive
black holes embedded in a cluster environment. We assume that black holes
accreting at low rates with respect to the Eddington limit are in a radiatively
inefficient regime, and that most of the feedback energy will appear in a
mechanical form. Thus, we introduce AGN-driven bubbles into the ICM with
properties, such as radius and energy content, that are directly linked to the
black hole physics. This model leads to a self-regulated mechanism for the
black hole growth and overcomes the cooling flow problem in host halos, ranging
from the scale of groups to that of massive clusters. (Abridged)",http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0610907v1
"One of the central features of the last 8 to 10 billion years of cosmic
history has been the emergence of a well-populated red sequence of
non-star-forming galaxies. A number of models of galaxy formation and evolution
have been devised to attempt to explain this behavior. Most current models
require feedback from supermassive black holes (AGN feedback) to quench star
formation in galaxies in the centers of their dark matter halos (central
galaxies). Such models make the strong prediction that all quenched central
galaxies must have a large supermassive black hole (and, by association, a
prominent bulge component). I show using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
that the observations are consistent with this prediction. Over 99.5% of red
sequence galaxies with stellar masses in excess of 10^{10} M_{\sun} have a
prominent bulge component (as defined by having a Sersic index n above 1.5).
Those very rare red sequence central galaxies with little or no bulge (n<1.5)
usually have detectable star formation or AGN activity; the fraction of truly
quenched bulgeless central galaxies is <0.1% of the total red sequence
population. I conclude that a bulge, and by implication a supermassive black
hole, is an absolute requirement for full quenching of star formation in
central galaxies. This is in agreement with the most basic prediction of the
AGN feedback paradigm.",http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4001v1
