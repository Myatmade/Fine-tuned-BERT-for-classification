## Contents

- Notebooks:
  - `Scraper.ipynb` — collects raw abstracts.
  - `Preprocessing data.ipynb` — cleans and combines datasets.
  - `MyatMaDeMayPhuuNgon_aifinal.ipynb` — model training and evaluation.
- Data:
  - Raw and cleaned CSVs in `data/`.

## How to use

MyatMaDeMayPhuuNgon_aifinal.ipynb contains all of the results and details for a deep understanding of the project.

Please feel free to explore other notebooks for a fuller understanding in order (scraping → preprocessing → training). The final notebook trains, and evaluates the fine-tuned BERT classifier.
